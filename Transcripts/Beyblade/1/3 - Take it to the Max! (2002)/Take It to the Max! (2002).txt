{{larger|{{sc|Take it<br>to the<br>Max}}}}

This is the one, Chief! I can feel it! Get up there!

That was close enough, wasn't it?

Close enough doesn't bring home the trophy.

Fine, double or nothing. Watch and weep! Bullseye! Oh yeah! That's two more chocolate bars you owe!

Alright, put them on my tab.

This little baby is my ticket to candy mountain. What say we raise the stakes to...ice cream?

Your sweet tooth isn't the only thing getting a workout, Tyson. You've been steadily improving your Beyblading skills as well.

I know what you're thinking, Kenny, but Tyson still has a long way to go. He may have Dragoon on his side, but it takes practice to control the power of a Bit-Beast. Just look at what happened to me.

You're still blaming me for that, after all we've been through, Dizzi? You know I didn't trap you inside my laptop on purpose.

Relax. I'm just messing with you, Kenny.

Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!

Hey! Come back with my Beyblade!

He must think it's a chewtoy.

What you got there, boy? You can be such a little pest sometimes, Sparky. Here you go!

Hehehehehe! Uh, it's covered in slobber.

Okay, come on boy!

Well, who knows? Maybe a little dog slobber will give it some extra spin.

Oh, yeah. I'd love to hear the scientific reasoning behind that!

Come on, Kenny, I was just making a little joke.

Science is no joke!

Hahahahahaha! You two really crack me up. Hahahahahahahahaha!

Do we know you?

I heard that there was a new kid in town. He moved here a few weeks ago, but it's the first time I've seen him.

Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!

Uh, he's here, hold that thought! Hmm?

Ahahahahaha! Hi there, pleased to meet you.

Ahh!

Huh?

Oh!

My poor, sweet little Sparky! Sparky! Sparky!

Come on, let's go!

Is now a good time to tell you I can't swim?

Someone help!

Oh, no, Sparky!

He's headed for the waterfall! This is bad! We've gotta step on it!

Whoa, last chance!

Careful, Tyson, you can't go in there. The current is way too strong for swimming.

I know.

Oh, I get it!

Okay, now watch this! Let it rip!

Oh.

That's it! Yeah!

Huh?

I hit the log dead-on, but it didn't budge!

Okay, let it rip!

Hey, I tried that shot already, and it didn't work!

You had the angle slightly wrong. Watch!

Huh?

I...got you!

Sparky!

Yeah!

Haha, awesome! Hey, we make a pretty good team. Now, let's go find my Beyblade.

Say goodbye, Sparky.

Man, you're pretty good with that Beyblade. What a great shot back there!

Thanks, but it was mostly luck. Boy, I hope that water didn't damage your Beyblade.

At least it washed off the dog slobber.

Better to be safe than sorry. We can give it a checkup at my dad's hobby store!

Hey, wait! You didn't even tell us your name.

Aha, oh, my name is Max. Sorry about that!

And I'm Tyson.

Come on, Kenny!

{{xxxx-larger|<u>Hobby-Shop</u>}} {{larger|BEY[...]}}

Well, it sounds like you two had quite an adventure, and the best news is your Beyblade's gonna pull through just fine. There you go.

{{smaller|'''BB'''}} {{xx-smaller|SHOP}}

Thanks a lot! I still can't get over how easy you made that shot look! Max is a total hero!

Sounds to me like you played as important a role.

Yeah, but my shot was just slightly off the mark. If Max hadn't come along when he did, we would have never been able to save that dog, so it's only right that he get the credit. It's a good thing you guys moved here when you did. So, Max, how about a test spin?

Oh... You bet!

We'll get along just fine, Max.

Come on, I want to show you something.

Okay, okay, enough keeping me in the dark already.

Hahaha. Surprise!

Is that cool!

Oh, is this ever sweet? Talking about being luckyâ€”your very own Bey stadium!

Would you believe it was here when we bought the place?

And Dad totally fixed it up for me.

That's very nice handiwork.

In all my life, I've never seen anything so wicked! You have to be the luckiest kid in the whole world! Hey, check this, Max. What say we break this baby in? You could teach me that shot you pulled today so that I'm ready the next time a puppy needs help.

Hmm...

But I'm training you.

Why can't you both teach me?

Excuse us for a moment!

Wahh, ahh!

Hey, Tyson, I don't think it's such a good idea letting Max train you.

But, why not?

Because we just met him this morning, and that shot was a little too perfect. Don't you find it strange that we happen to bump into the new expert Beyblader in town just in the nick of time, and that he happens to have a Bey stadium in his basement?

Hehe, you're totally jealous.

Huh?

It's obvious you're worried Max is trying to take your place. But it's not really like that at all. So give him a chance, Chief. You'll see.

I guess...

Hey, Max, you ready to show me some of those moves?

Mhm.

Okay! So, uh, have a look at the competition!

Hey, nice! Let's see it fly!

Ah, yes. Well, well, well, so this is where they set up shop.

Hmm... Looks like Max uses an easy grip shooter. That should give him edge and accuracy, without losing any spin. Good thing Tyson has the power of Dragoon to even things up.

Seems fair. But let's get a second opinion on this.

Well, it's about time!

Okay, ready, get set, and three, two, one, and go!

Let it rip!

Back at you, Tyson!

Come on, Dragoon! Show him what you've got. Go!

Hey, that's some serious rotation you've got there!

Haha, you can't beat me by just spinning in place like that!

Uh, Tyson, there's something Dizzi thinks you should know.

Yeah, what?

Ooh, someone woke up on the grouch side of the bed today.

According to our data, Max is using a special defensive style of Beyblade. So, despite what you may think, you're not actually doing any damage.

Please tell me you're kidding, Chief! My entire attack is useless, then? Pretty sneaky strategy you've got there, my friend.

Hey, thanks, because they say that the best offense is to have a good defense. Hahaha, I saw it written on a license plate.

Hehe! You may think you're wearing me down, but I've got another trick up my sleeve!

This I've gotta see!

Come on, Dragoon! Quit fooling around! Push him over the top! Almost there!

I think not, because you've just ran out of steam.

Aw, not cool!

Gee, didn't see that coming.

Uh, at least it was a learning experience.

Sorry, Tyson, but Max wins this one.

Yes! This is the best day of my life! Just joking.

So much for getting better!

Come on, Tyson, it was a great fight! You have some nice moves. But there's still one thing that you need to learn.

What's that?

Oh, just a little something I like to call patience. It takes time to improve a skill.

Uh, how much?

I actually agree with Max on this one. You can't expect to become an expert Beyblader after one little match.

Rgh, ngh! Whose side are you on, anyways, Chief?

Don't worry, Tyson, we'll keep at it for as long as it takes. I'll show you how to achieve maximum speed and accuracy, and before you know it, you'll be out saving all kinds of puppies all by yourself.

Rgh! It's always about the puppies. Heh! How can I say no to that? Alright, let's hit the dish!

Sure.

Wait till you see my Bit-Beast Dragoon in action!

Might I suggest you two postpone your battle until a little later?

Good day, Mr. Dickenson.

I like the new shop, Mr. Tate.

I'd like you to meet someone. This is Mr. Stanley A. Dickenson. He's the chairman of the BBA.

BBA? The Beyblade Battle Association?

So you've heard of this guy?

I sure have! He heads up an organization that promotes and trains the world's top Beybladers, making him the most important man in the sport!

Hahaha!

What brings you here, Mr. Dickenson?

He used to be our best customer at the old shop, but now he's a good friend of the family. Unless of course you've come here on business.

Uh, I just wanted you to be the first to hear about this year's events. Have a look, boys.

Wha?

Huh?

{{smaller|BEYBLADE}}<br>{{x-smaller|BATTLE<br>TOURNAMENT}}

Hey! Beyblade Battle Tournament?

Yes, that's right. It's a qualifying tournament I'm sponsoring that will bring Beybladers from all over the country. And when all the battles are said and done, my company will know precisely who the best Beybladers are.

Ah, just think of all the stats!

Yes, too cool! I can hardly wait!

Ah! What's wrong, Tyson?

If there's a tournament, you can be sure Kai will be there.

Have you heard of him?

As a matter of fact, he's already entered.

Wha?

Kai may not be the friendliest of fellows, but he's a top-notch competitor, as well as being the returning champion.

Kai's the returning champion?

Well, what do you say, boys? You think you've got what it takes to win this thing? Hahahahahahaha!

Hey, aren't you excited? And I think he's right. We should start practicing for the big tournament. Maybe we can train together!

Awesome! Let's get started!

Who knows, guys, maybe I'll even let you win this time.

Ehh! Hey, what do you say no matter who wins the tournament, we should totally cheer for each other, okay?

What a cool idea that is! You're on!

Haha, just great. Wait till my grandpa hears. I'm gonna need some major training. I'm sure it'll be worth all the hard work, though...just to see Kai's face when I win.

How long?

Man, it's been almost ten minutes!

Go to stage two, now!

Huh? But...but, Kai...

You can't expect to take us all on at one time!

Yes, that happens to be the plan, unless you want to throw in the towel.

Ready, and...release!

Gasp!

Gasp!

Oh, oh, it can't be! That's not possible!

Heh! I invented the word ''possible''.

That's why I am the champ...whether I like it, or not.

You were right. Max is okay in my books.

I told you, Chief. After all, how many other friends do we have that would teach us all their Beyblade tricks, even with a tournament on the line? I knew you'd come around eventually.

I guess I was just a...a little bit jealous.

You have nothing to worry about, Chief! I don't know what I would ever do without you! I bow to Kenny, the computer wizard.

Sigh...

You know, you could knock before you burst in like that!

Sorry about that, Dizzi, but we need to find a way to improve Tyson's Beyblade.

What's wrong with my Beyblade just the way it is?

I hope you realize that Dragoon alone won't guarantee you a victory, Tyson. In any given match you have to first analyze the strength of your opponent, then find a way to defend against it.

As well as plan an attack of your own.

And all at the same time!

How am I supposed to remember all that?

Nobody said becoming a tournament-class Beyblader would be easy. So, we start with the smallest of steps.

Oh, man! Isn't there some way we can skip the boring lecture and cut right to the chase?

I'm afraid not. The road to victory must always start with a boring lecture, after which there will be a test! Any other questions?

If Beyblading is so complicated, how come I've done so well till now?

Hey, that is a good question.

Dragoon shouldn't have any trouble winning matches, right?

Don't you see, Tyson? You have the power, but you don't know how to control it!

And I suppose you do, right? You may be an expert at building Beyblades, but when it comes to actually using one, you're all thumbs. And let's not forget you trapped your own Bit-Beast inside your computer! Whoa, I'm sorry, Kenny!

Oh, it's okay. Don't worry about it.

Uh, wait, I'm sorry. Come back, Kenny!

Uh, ugh!

That went well. Don't mind me while I stick my big foot in my big mouth! Ugh! Aw, I blew that one big-time!

Heads up, dude!

I'm not ready yet, Grandpa.

Well, that's kinda the whole point of the exercise, my man. You've gotta learn to always be on the lookout. Now, then, I say let's get it going on!

Just let me get set up! Then maybe I'll give you a taste of your own training lance, Grandpa!

Hahahahahaha! Now, time to practice! Start getting hip to what I'm putting down, or you're in big trouble!

Sigh, kay. Let's get to work then.

You know I love it when you take charge!

Kenny? What you doing here all by yourself?

Max!

Thanks for the hot tip.

So, is...this where you come to be alone with your thoughts?

Yes, but only when I can't get anyone else to listen to them.

Hahahaha. Yeah, I know what you mean. It can get pretty lonely being the new kid in town, you know?

Well, you're stuck with us now.

Dizzi is right. You're part of the gang now, so you might as well get used to it. Ihihi!

Hey, thanks! You and Tyson have been totally cool! I can't believe how lucky I was to bump into you guys this morning! And to think I was getting a weird vibe like maybe you didn't want to be friends with me. I couldn't have been more wrong! So you wanna meet later or something?

Hmm... Yeah.

Kay, here's what we do. You go and get Tyson. Then we'll all meet back at my dad's shop, and help build our Beyblades. Bye!

Huah, ahh!

Get with it, dude! A move that slow couldn't catch a turtle!

Rgh! You wanna see speed?

Hahahahahaha!

Ahh! Take this! Huah! Huah! Huah! Huah! Huah! Huah! Huah! Huah!

Hmm... You can take all the swings you like, dude, but until you can figure out my next dance move, I'll always be one step ahead.

Hey, that's what Kenny was trying to tell me.

Tyson!

Huh?

Check out these sweet moves!

Hoo! Ha! Hoo! Ha! Ha! Ha! Huo! Ha! Ha! Ha!

What's going on? Grandpa's moving so fast, it looks like there's a whole bunch of him.

Show me what you got, my man!

Wait! If I can keep track of where Grandpa is, and from that figure out where he's going to be next, then it's just a matter of timing my shot perfectly. And if I put my mind to it, the same strategy can be applied to a Beyblade attack.

Yes! Attack!

Ah, not bad, dude!

I know I still need a lot of practice, but I totally get it now.

Hahahahahaha!

Tyson's a tough nut to crack. Heh, but I'm just the man to break through his shell.

Okay, let's see, Kai has developed his Beyblade to perform with incredible balance, while Max is constantly in defensive mode. Now, all I gotta do is find a way to counter both of their strategies, and I'll be the new champion!

What's this?

Let it rip! Go, Dragoon!

Huh? Don't tell me he's actually training!

Oh! Look at it go! It's like a blur!

I have never seen anything like this!

Wow, oh!

Since when does he have that kind of power?

Oh... Oh, wow!

Hey, Kenny.

What happened?

Huh?

Oh, yes, yes! I finally controlled the power of the Dragoon!

What you doing?

I need to update your stats page to reflect your increased power levels. Then I can figure out your best course of action against future opponents.

You must be a lot of fun at parties.

Sounds real cool.

Oh, and Chief?

Huh?

Sorry about before. I shouldn't have said all those things.

Aw, that's okay. I can understand how frustrating being the best can be.

Hehehehe! Hmm... Well, we'll just have to see about that. Aw, man, that wall is toast.

Actually, I can have that looking like new in no time.

You the man, Kenny! I don't know what I'd even do without you and your skills, Chief! You know, as long as the two of us stick together, there's nothing we can't achieve!

Now you're talking.

{{larger|DAY<br>OF THE<br>DRAGOON}}

Come on! Ready?

Go!

Let it rip!

Excellent! With my Blade spinning four times faster, Kai doesn't even stand a chance against me.

Hmph.

What's going on?

That's it!

Huh?

Kai's Beyblade is feeding off the energy of Tyson's Blade, and that makes both of them equal.

Finish him!

Battle's only started!

Oh no! Now what's Kai up to?

My Beyblade!

Hehehehe!

Oh... He...wasted my Beyblade!

You see, Carlos? If you understand how to feed off your opponent's strength, you win.

What? That's not fair! Bet's off!

Come on, let's go.

Hey! You come back here!

Rgh! No!

Let's go!

Look, trust me. It's not worth it. If you really want to beat him, Tyson, then you're gonna need a strategy.

Rgh! I guess you're right, Andrew, but that Kai really...got under my skin! Rgh! Alright! I'm gonna practice until I know for sure I can beat him! Kai! Do you hear me?

So this is where Tyson lives, huh?

Yeah, I'm pretty sure that this is it.

He must be really bummed out.

Hey, dudes!

Ahh!

What's up with you, my homeboys?

We just stopped by to see if Tyson was at home.

I'm hip! Little dude's inside practicing. He's in the dojo.

Beyblading?

Huah!

Martial arts.

Huah! Huah! Huah! En garde!

You won with the Blade, but I'll show you.

This fight isn't over by a long shot!

Huah! Huah!

Huh? It's the sword again! And it seems like the power of the Dragoon inside is trying to tell me something, but what?

Hey, Dragoon! If you can hear me, what's up with you anyway?

Ahh!

Hey, Tyson!

Huh? Hiya, Chief. Andrew, what's going on?

We just...stopped by to see how you were.

I've never felt better in my whole life! So, you guys wanna come in for a while?

Are you sure?

Yeah?

Yeah.

We were kind of worried about you, Tyson.

You know, after losing to Kai and all. I guess it was really no big deal.

Yeah, exactly. I'll get him back.

Well, good luck, Tyson, because Kai's the best Beyblader around. Ever heard of the Blade Sharks?

No.

Probably the toughest Beybladers around, and they're out to win the ultimate Blade for themselves at any price.

So, what kind of Blade is he looking for anyway?

A Beyblade with the ultimate Bit-Beast that no one can ever beat. And legend has it that there's Beyblades out there that are powered by different kinds of beasts like tigers and lions and even...dragons. And Kai won't let anyone or anything stand in his way until he finds them.

Wait a sec, that's it!

What's it?

Hehehe! All we have to do is build the ultimate Blade! With you, me, and Kenny it'll be a cinch. And then we'll see who has the last laugh!

You don't get it.

What do you mean?

You can't just build a Beyblade–you don't have the right Bit piece.

Ha! That's a bunch of baloney. Come on!

Come on in, guys.

This is all your stuff?

Yeah, all that junk is my stuff, and I guess we're going to have to pull it all together.

What exactly do you mean by "we?"

Hmm... We... I mean, the three of us.

Actually, there's four of us.

He means Dizzi.

What?

I was meaning to introduce Dizzi to you–that's Dizzira for short. She's the Bit-Beast in my computer. Kind of funny how she got inside, too. One day, when I plugged in my laptop, there was a massive power surge, and before you know it, zap–I heard this voice! Hi, Dizzi.

What took you so long, Chief? Gee, I was beginning to think you didn't like me anymore.

Sorry, guys, but...she's a little temperamental.

What the heck is a Bit-Beast, anyway?

The best thing that ever happened to me! Dizzi knows everything about Beyblades!

Huh? Really?

Yeah, really.

Heh, well, what are we waiting for? Tell old Dizzy we've got a Blade to build! Hahahahaha!

You bet! Dizzy, do your stuff.

That's what I'm here for.

Yes!

Okay, boys, if you want to beat Kai at his own game, you're going to have to do exactly as I tell you, and I mean exactly. Oh, and if it wouldn't be too much trouble, could you hook up the adapter and plug me in? I'm starting to feel a little sluggish.

Kai! I'm really sorry!

You have embarrassed the Blade Sharks, Carlos. We have never lost a match.

No! No! No! Please, Kai! You can't do this to me!

Sorry.

I'll do anything!

Ahh!

Too late!

{{SIC|Shell Sharks|Blade Sharks}}, let it rip!

No! Stop it!

Ahh!

Hmph!

No, no, no!

You disappoint me, Carlos.

No!

Any word on that Beyblade we've been looking for?

Yeah, I heard something pretty interesting, Kai, about these guys who are rebuilding a Blade. Supposedly, that kid they call the Chief has been collecting data on Blades from around the world.

And I heard that he keeps all the Beyblade information in a laptop that he talks to.

Very interesting.

According to my sources, they don't live too far from here. So if you want, we could check them out.

Not a bad idea.

Ready?

Yeah.

Let it rip!

Yeah, that's it!

Rgh!

Well?

The power level is still too low.

She's not kidding, is she?

Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

Ah, nuts! So, what's the problem, Chief?

Like Dizzi said, our power is not even close to matching Kai's Dranzer, and you wouldn't stand a chance against him.

Are you serious?

Dead serious, and to be perfectly honest, I don't even know how to increase the power in your Blade.

Don't get down on yourself. Hey, it was the best Blade I've ever fought with, so why don't we just build a new one?

But I still feel bad.

Sigh... Well I'm not giving up yet!

Huh? Really?

Come on, guys! We've only started to fight. I'm going to practice over and over again until I've figured out a technique to beat Kai's Dranzer Blade! You with me?

Ah!

And, Chief, I'm really gonna need you help, pal.

Hey! What about me, Tyson? I helped you just as much as he did, you know.

Ah, come on, would you quit being such a crybaby, Andrew? You know you're in, so quit your griping!

I wish I was as excited about this as Tyson. It's just that I'm not so sure we could make a Beyblade as powerful as Dranzer. Unless...I go home and dig up some more data.

Uh, guys, I'd really love to stick around and chat, but I gotta go. I forgot something at home.

Okay. I'll see you.

Yeah, ahaha!

Hey, what is this? Who are you?

So you're the one they call the Chief.

Huh?

What do you want? Ahh! Hey, let go of me!

I'll take that.

Ahh! Hey! Hey!

Ahh! Help! I'm being robbed!

Hey, isn't that the Chief?

Sounds like he's being mugged by the Blade Sharks!

Ahh!

Let's get out of here!

Ha! I think we're starting to make some progress.

I know you can do it!

It's only a matter of time before we're ready for battle, and I can hardly wait! Ha!

Just keep at it, bud.

Hey, Tyson!

Where are you?

Are you home?

Hey! Hey, you guys, what's going on?

Tyson!

Andrew!

Yeah?

You sure it was him?

Yeah, I heard one of them call him Chief.

Did you see where they took him?

I think to some kind of warehouse.

We thought we could save him by following them, but there were just too many of them.

You'd better hurry, because he might be in danger.

Those blasted Blade Sharks! Rgh!

Wait a second. What do you think you're doing?

Agh! What do you think? I've gotta go back and save him!

That's crazy, Tyson! You can't do it alone!

But we can't just stay here and do nothing! Agh! Aw, man! I've got a feeling this is gonna put a major dent into our development program.

Oh...

Hey, Andrew, didn't you say Kai is looking for the ultimate Beyblade?

What are you saying?

I think it's time to take on the Sharks, and save our friend.

Are you nuts? You could never beat them! Tyson, you know as well as I do that our Blade isn't even close to winning yet!

Maybe I can't win, but I've gotta go and give it my best shot.

You are crazy! You'll end up wrecking another Blade!

A guy's gotta do what a guy's gotta do.

Tyson! At least let's think about this, alright?

Huh?

Don't get me wrong, old buddy, but you can't just walk in there alone! Come on, guys, we've gotta save the Chief!

Haha, alright!

Last one there is a rotten egg!

Hey, wait up!

Or has to eat one!

Agh! That's the spirit! Yeah, let's do it!

I know this sounds kind of stupid, but if the Dragoon can hear me–well, I was just wondering if you could help me and my friends save our buddy. You see, he needs our help, and I don't know what else to do.

I know you've been in my family for generations, and my grandpa once said that if I needed help, I should ask you. Well, thanks anyways.

Ahh! Gasp!

What's going on? Last time I saw him, I thought I was dreaming, but this is too weird! The Dragoon really does exist!

Holy cow! And he's headed straight for me!

Ahh!

Whoa!

What? He went right into my Beyblade!

Huh? Freaky...

Wait a sec... The Dragoon's power is inside my Blade!

Huh?

Huh?

What's this?

Welcome! You have new mail.

Please, give me back my laptop!

Put a sock in it.

It's mine!

So, tell me, is this all the data you have?

Excuse me, but your hands are cold.

Huh?

Hey, this bites. I thought...you were supposed to know everything there is about Beyblades.

I do know everything, but you'll never get it out of me!

Get your filthy hands off of him!

Tyson! Andrew!

Huh?

Hey, Stuart, looks like we've got company.

I challenge you to a battle, and winner-take-all!

Don't do it, Tyson! You can't win. That Blade isn't nearly strong enough to take on the Sharks and you know it!

Don't worry, I've got a secret weapon! Hehehe.

Right on! Ow!

Hehehe! Stop flapping your gums and let's see what you've got.

Wait!

Huh?

I'll take it from here.

But, Kai...

Enough!

Uh, sure.

Hmm...

So you've come back for more. Just know one thing kid—you can't beat me.

Well, we'll just see about that!

Hmph!

Tyson!

Rgh! I don't know what kind of power you have, Dragoon, but you're my last hope, so please, if you can hear me, I need your help!

Hey, you ready?

Let it rip!

I thought you would've learned by now, there's no way you can beat me!

Augh!

You fool.

These battles get really old.

Rgh! Not again!

Tyson, the spin from your Blade is causing a tornado, and Kai's Dranzer is being sucked into its vortex!

I...I win!

If you think the fight is over, you're wrong. Battle on, Dranzer!

No one can beat the power of my Beyblade!

Hey, his Blade just lit up!

What in the world is going on here?

Battle on, Dranzer!

Huh? Oh no!

Unbelievable! I've never read about this in my data.

What just happened here?

Man, now that was freaky!

Did you see the Dragoon? He smashed head-on with that birdie thingy.

I've never seen anything like that before! And how did that dragon get inside your Blade?

Uh...

Are you too blind to see?

Hey, there, what do you mean?

Then I'll explain it to you. Your blue dragon and my red phoenix are trapped within our Blades, and not every Blade possesses the spirit of the Beast.

Uh, I don't get it.

Yeah, me either?

Our Beyblades aren't ordinary. Our Bit-Beasts are powered by incredible forces that are trapped within. Yours is the power of the Dragoon, and mine is powered by the Dranzer.

Would someone untie me? I'm starting to chafe!

Hmph. In time my friend.

Hey! Where do you think you're going?

Ahh! Uh, uh...

If you think this battle is over, then you are sadly mistaken. It's only just begun.

Sigh...

Tyson?

Yeah?

Thanks, for saving me.

Hahaha!

I guess I don't have all the data on Blades after all.

Huh?

I've got lots more research to do.

Don't sweat it! Next time I meet up with that whoosh Kai, I'll show him who's king of the Blades! You mark my word, kid.

But, Tyson, what if your Blade's not powerful enough?

It will be.

Maybe you should give me your Beyblade so Dizzi and I can analyze its energy.

What for? It's powered by Dragoon!

Who's Dragoon?

Uh, it's a long story, Andrew, but let's just say the power's been in the family for generations, and it's all right here, in the palm of my hand.

Well, whatever it is, it sure is wicked!

Haha! You sure hit the nail on the head, Chief. It's wicked!

{{ft|Tyson|What you're doing...it's just plain wrong. To us Beybladers, our Blades are what represents us in battle, whether we win or lose. We fight together, we win and lose together, we even fix them together. So, how dare you take them away from us?}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tyson|Hey, take a breath, and then tell me who you are.}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kenny|Oh, yeah, around here they call me the Chief. They call me the Chief because I'm an expert on Beyblading.}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kenny|Okay, Dizzi, what have you got for us?}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dizzi|Check this out, guys. The blue one is Andrew's Beyblade, and the yellow one's Carlos's.}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tyson|Andrew's Blade looks wicked.}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Andrew|You think?}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tyson|Huh?}}
}}

----

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dizzi|Game over! And the loser is Andrew!}}
}}

----

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Everyone|Wow!}}
}}

----

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tyson|Hey, wait a sec... That's it! Yeah, Carlos's Beyblade is way heavier than Andrew's Blade. So, that's the reason he's able to beat everyone he challenges. Think about it. A heavier Blade makes it more stable, and that makes it last ten times longer in battle.}}
}}

----

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kenny|Bingo!}}
}}

----

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dizzi|Give the boy a medal! Watch as I zoom in and dissect Carlos's Beyblade for you. See how he's rebuilt it using a heavier metal alloy? The extra weight gives it more stability.}}

----

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kenny|Oh, yeah, which means any of our ordinary Blades don't stand any chance against his.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tyson|There's gotta be some way of beating him!}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dizzi|You have to build a faster Beyblade.}}

{{ft|Kenny|Four times faster.}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tyson|Huh?}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tyson|Yes! All I gotta do is make the winder twice as long!}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dizzi|The good news is Tyson remains undefeated, but the bad news is Carlos has never lost either.}}

{{ft|Kenny|Oh, now I get it!}}

----

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dizzi|That's right, Chief. Once you factor in the rip cord being twice as long, combined with Tyson's running start technique, you end up with four times the spin. Now, on a personal note, when are you and I going to have some alone time?}}

{{ft/d|

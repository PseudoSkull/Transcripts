Catch you later, Grandpa.

Come back!

Man: Hey, what's your hurry, Tyson?

Tyson: I'm running late. What time is it?

Uh, let's see, it's 3:45, or is that my heart rate?

Thank you!

Hehehe!

Hey what's the big idea, Billy?

Tyson, why, we was just looking for you.

That's right, Billy.

I don't have time for this. So, why don't we have a group hug?

Eww.

Alright, I've had it.

What about that hug? I mean, wouldn't the world be a better place if we could all just get along?

First, we have a little score to settle.

What do you mean?

You know... It's Beyblade.

Beyblade?

Come on, Tyson, don't you play dumb with me. You promised me we'd battle!

Oh, yeah. I guess I did say that.

Well then?

Let's do it!

Just say the word.

Anytime.

Ready?

Set?

Let it...rip!

Oh, man. Beyblades are so cool!

Is this your first time seeing them?

Yeah.

Well, check it out. To win a battle, all you have to do is knock the other guy's Beyblade out of the stadium. It's pretty intense, but with an awesome blade, and a little luck, you're the winner!

Yeah!

Ahh!

Hehehe!

Ahh! Why do you keep torturing me?

Hey, you're Blade's sweet. You should hang on to it.

Well, how come I always lose then?

It's not all just about the Beyblade. I've had this one forever. It's about how much time you spend practicing. I even dream about it.

How about two out of three, Tyson?

Uh... Hey, what time is it?

It's 4:10.

Ahh! I'm so late! I gotta go!

But, just where do you think you're going?

I've got a Bey battle against Andrew!

Did he just say...Andrew?

Who's Andrew?

He's a legend in this neighborhood. He's the best!

So, where is he? I bet he chickened out!

I told you he wouldn't show.

Don't worry he'll show.

Yeah, sure.

I know Tyson, and he'll come. At..least I'm pretty sure. And then we can decide for sure who's the real Beyblade champ.

I'm looking for someone named Andrew.

Hehehehehe!

Huh?

Can we help you?

The name is...Carlos.

Carlos?

So, is that your Beyblade?

Yeah.

Hmph...wimpy.

Huh?

Hey, you! What's your deal anyway?

Cool it. So, you think you can beat me?

Yeah. Yeah, not a problem.

I'd like to see you try.

Great, then let's see what you got.

Sure.

Uh, Andrew...

Oh, if you want to challenge me, there's one thing you gotta know.

One thing?

Yeah. Just one little thing. Hehe!

Sorry I'm late. Huh?

Wha? What's up with you guys? Have you seen a ghost or something?

I know I'm good looking, but you don't have to gawk with your mouthes open!

Tyson, I'm sorry, but our Bey battle is off this afternoon.

Wha? You can't be serious!

He's saying get lost, kid. What don't you get, huh?

I'm gonna take your little friend's Blade away, and you're next on my list. Why don't you watch and learn?

Tyson, this guy is a Shark who goes around and wins everyone's Blades.

Huh? Hey, that can't be true!

Oh, yeah? Then I must have picked up the wrong sack at the cleaner's?

Hahahahahahahahahahaha!

Ugh, man!

What?

What you're doing...it's just plain wrong. To us Beybladers, our Blades are what represents us in battle, whether we win or lose. We fight together, we win and lose together, we even fix them together. So, how dare you take them away from us?

For the fun of it, I guess. Hehehehehe! Hahahahahahahaha!

What's so funny?

It's probably just a nervous laugh I use to hide my insecurities. But, seriously, I guess I just like watching people lose. Must be some kind of...gift. Hahahahahahahaha!

I've had it! I've gotta put a stop to you!

Whatever. Just don't cry when I take your Blade.

Wow!

Huh?

Wait, hang on a second. I've got something to show you.

What do you mean? Show us what?

Tyson, take a good look at this Bey stadium. Does it remind you of anything?

Huh?

Oh, Carlos. Someone as good as you isn't just looking to take one Blade, right? So can you just hang on for a minute, then?

Hmph, you're stalling.

Out of my way! Ahh! What did you do that for?

I don't have time for this. There's plenty of other Blades to win.

What? You're leaving?

That's right. So give me a call when you're ready...to play in the big leagues.

Bring it on, buddy! I'm ready for you! Ahh! Ahh! Ow! Ow! Augh! Augh!

Okay, let's meet tomorrow at 3 at the river—winner take all.

Done! But if I win, you're gonna have to give back all the Beyblades you took from everyone. Got it?

Pfft, like that will ever happen. Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!

Ow! Man, that hurts!

Sigh. Oh sure, I guess we sure scared him off, huh? Did you see the look on his face?

Hey, take a breath, and then tell me who you are.

Oh, yeah, around here they call me the Chief. They call me the Chief because I'm an expert on Beyblading.

Expert?

And I know everything about you. See? You're even in my database.

Are you serious?

Excuse me, Kenny, but why don't you introduce me to your cute little friend?

Hey, I think your laptop has a thing for me.

Oh, yeah, that's just my Bit-Beast.

You've got a Bit-Beast trapped inside your computer?

Call me Dizzy, and remember, the name is not a reflection of my intelligence.

This is too weird!

Okay, Dizzy, what have you got for us?

Check this out, guys. The blue one is Andrew's Beyblade, and the yellow one's Carlos's.

Andrew's Blade looks wicked.

You think?

Before you get too excited, Tyson, watch this.

Huh?

Game over! And the loser is Andrew!

Wow!

Hey, wait a sec... That's it! Yeah, Carlos's Blade is way heavier than Andrew's Blade. So, that's the reason he's able to beat everyone he challenges. Think about it. A heavier Blade makes it more stable, and that makes it last ten times longer in battle.

Bingo!

Give the boy a medal! Watch as I zoom in and dissect Carlos's Beyblade for you. See how he's rebuilt it using a heavier metal alloy? The extra weight gives it more stability.

Oh, yeah, which means any of our ordinary Blades don't stand any chance against his.

There's gotta be some way of beating him!

You have to build a faster Beyblade!

Well, what are we waiting for? That'll be a snap!

Four times faster...

Really?

Don't get ahead of yourselves. Getting a Blade to spin four times faster isn't easy.

Mhm! Let's do it!

So what do we do, Chief?

How am I supposed to know? I haven't figured that part out yet.

You've gotta figure out something, or we are done!

Tyson!

Huh?

Just forget about it! We'll never win!

Huh?

There's no way any of us can build a Blade strong enough. And we can't build one that fast. So, we might as well forget about it.

Rgh! Come on, you guys. We can't give up now! We can do this!

Huh?

If we all work together, then we can show that Carlos who's boss around here, can't we?

We can?

You bet we can! We're not afraid of Carlos or anybody like him. We're not afraid of anything! Come on guys! We're gonna build the best Beyblade the world has ever seen!

Oh, boy.

I think he's lost it.

Four times... Four times... Four times!

Tyson?

Four times!

Tyson?

Hmm?

Little dude, I don't think I can handle your daydreaming much longer.

Huh?

Did you hear me, huh?

That's it! Later!

What's with him?

Yes! All I gotta do is make the winder twice as long!

Hmm. Oh, man, that is only twice as fast. And there's no way I can make the winder any longer!

That's it. Okay, I give up, and that makes Carlos the big winner.

Huh?

What's going on? What's that?

It's the Dragoon!

What's it doing?

Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

Huh? Huh? Hmm?

My Blade! Hmm... Huh...

Hey, the Dragoon! That was just too cool!

Agh!

Huh?

Rgh! Ugh! Oh, I'm gonna do it this time!

So that's why the little dude was in such a hurry yesterday!

Let it rip! Ugh!

Oh, man! I've just gotta get my Blade up to speed!

Well, I gotta admit it... He's as fly as I am.

Agh!

The kid's wacky! Ahaha!

You see him?

Nothing. Wonder what's keeping him.

Don't worry, he's gonna show up, alright.

But...do you think he can...beat him?

Hahahaha!

Okay, Dizzy, what do you have for me?

The good news is that Tyson remains undefeated. The bad news is that Carlos has never lost either.

And if you factor in the stability of Carlos's Beyblade, which gives him the advantage, the bottom line is Tyson is going to go down like the ''Titanic''.

Hmph!

Hey guys!

Yes, you made it!

Can you win, Tyson?

Yeah, can you?

So, we all set?

Oh, I'm ready whenever you are.

Whoa!

Ha, so you've made the winder longer. I hope you don't think you're the first to try that lame trick. Save yourself the trouble—it doesn't work.

Bring it on!

Now what you doing? Trying out some crazy lame technique?

You'll see!

Yeah, whatever.

Oh, ready. Get set!

Go!

Let it rip!

Oh, now I get it!

That's right, Chief. Once you factor in the rip cord being twice as long, combined with Tyson's running start technique, you end up with four times the spin. On a personal note, when are you and I going to have some alone time?

You're toast!

Hey, why don't you just give me your Beyblade instead of wasting my time?

Amazing!

I'm surprised at you, Chief. I thought you had this all figured out.

Yeah!

Carlos just got nailed!

What? I've never seen a Blade so powerful!

Ahh!

Haha!

No!

Haha!

Agh! No, impossible!

I am the man, hahahahahahahaha!

Way to go, Tyson!

Hey, there's no way I could've beat him if it wasn't for you, Chief! I appreciate it.

Aww!

Tyson, you were awesome!

Aw, shucks. It was nothing! Any other totally intelligent, highly skilled, regular, good-looking kid could've done it.

My hero, Tyson!

Knock it off, will you?

Hey, Carlos, don't forget our little bet!

Ah!

What's up, huh?

Wah! Ahh!

I always knew this day would come.

Ahh!

You have proven yourself unworthy, Carlos.

No! No, don't!

Ahh!

Hey! Just who do you think you are, coming around here like that, some kind of tough guy?

The name is...Kai. I'm leader of the Blade Sharks, kid.

Huh? Let's play!

No, don't Tyson! Don't!

Yeah, don't!

Look, the Blade Sharks are the toughest Bey gang around. They've never been beaten before!

Huh?

Challenge accepted! But first I must warn you. Take a look—my Dranzer Blade!

Whoa!

I've never seen such a wicked Blade!

Get ready!

Ready?

Go!

Let it rip!

You're going down, Kai!

Go ahead and try, Tyson!

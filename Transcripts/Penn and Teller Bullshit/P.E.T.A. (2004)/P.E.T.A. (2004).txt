{{ft|Penn Jillette|You might be wondering what our friend is doing here. Well, he's one of the many creators of bullshit! And he has a vested interest in this show because we're taking a look at the {{w|animal rights movement}} in general, and more specifically, a group called PETA, {{w|People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals}}. These are folks who don't want animals killed, hurt, exploited, or embarrassed. OK, we're gonna try it their way. We aren't gonna tease or abuse the bull. He doesn't have a cute name like Elsie or Moo-Moo or Heifer-Lips. His name is Dave—nothing funny about that!

{{ft|Penn Jillette|We call our show ''Bullshit!'', so you know what you're getting, but what do you get with a group that puts "ethical" right in its name? Ethical means "moral" or "proper," which differs for every person. It's something that you discuss. It's not an absolute. It just sounds nice. It's like {{w|Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice}} and {{w|Anti-abortion movements|pro-life}}. I mean, come on! Everyone is pro-choice and pro-life. It's for or against abortion that your group is about. And who wouldn't want to treat animals ethically, anyway?

{{ft|Ingrid Newkirk|I have one more thing to say to them. Remember this. Rights movements never go away. They always get stronger, they always attract more people, and there is no point whatsoever in wasting your time fighting them, because we will grow, and we will win, and that's a fact!}}

{{ft|Penn Jillette|No animals were harmed in the making of this episode of ''Bullshit!''. Well, except the fucking chickens. Oh, and the ribs—that's a cow—and our sexy leather boy outfits, and the fur coats, and, oh, you know, a lot of the food is catered and they served some meats. There's probably a couple of diabetics in the crew that need insulin. I almost forgot Teller's ass. And I guess the building we tape in has some animal products, because they're commonly used in brick, plaster, cement, and insulation. Some of the furniture was probably made using animal-based glue, and there's a lot of animal stuff used in musical instruments, so maybe the theme song injured some animals. Oh, and the videotape contains {{w|mylar}}, and that's made from animal by-products, but other than that though...}}

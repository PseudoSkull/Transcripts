{{ft|Angela|This was me and my family before we won the lottery, and this is me and my family after we won the lottery, and this is all the neat stuff my parents bought me with our new lottery money.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Classmates|Ooh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Stuff like these remote control shoes that lace up all by themselves.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Classmates|Aah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|This coat is made of a special space-age material. It's waterproof, fireproof, and freezeproof. And, if I'm ever out riding my bike at night...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Classmates|Aah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|And if I'm ever lost at sea...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Classmates|Ooh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Thank you, Angela.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|But, Miss Gotto, I haven't shown everyone my designer rock collection yet.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Maybe another day, dear. Now, next presentation—Mona. Mona, it's time for your presentation, and please, remove those rubber spiders from your ears.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|My presentation has to do with a dark, almost-impossible-to-believe mystery right here in our town—the horrifying creature that is...the Living Scarecrow! Every night, it leaves the graveyard in search of its favorite snack—human brains! Its victims become zombies—the living undead—just like Mr. Arley, the church gardener. All alone in the church garden one night, he didn't have a chance. With the power inside his hat, the Living Scarecrow neutralized him and ate his brain, turning him into a zombie. Poor Mr. Arley disappeared, never to be seen again.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|All right, Mona, that's enough. As we all know, poor Mr. Arley did not disappear. He moved back to Connecticut with his sister.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|That's just what the Living Scarecrow wants us to think! There's only one way to defeat the Living Scarecrow. The source of its power is in its hat! But no Living Scarecrow is a match for Mona the Vampire!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Mona! Next presenter—Charley Bones.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|My presentation is a tribute to one of my favorite elements in the periodic table. Welcome to the wonderful world of carbon!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|There is no Living Scarecrow and you're no vampire.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Is too! Am so!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Is not! Are not! No one believes you.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|I believe her! I'll stand up for you, Mona. Agh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Hey, Knees, you scuffed my ball!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Sorry, George.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|If you're a real vampire, and only a real vampire can stop the Living Scarecrow, then I dare you to stop him, tonight, and bring his hat to school tomorrow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Unh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I'll do it! You'll get that hat.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|How would you like to help me play a practical joke?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Dad, where are my glow-in-the-dark fangs?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Right where you left them—on the kitchen sink.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I'm going to meet Charley and Lily. We're going to stop the Living Scarecrow from eating everybody's brains.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|All right, sweetheart, but make sure you're home before Mom gets back from karate class.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I'll explain it one more time. When the Living Scarecrow eats someone's brain, that person becomes a zombie. Without a brain, zombies have a poor sense of direction. They get lost, and, so, they disappear, just like Mr. Arley.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|There he is—the Living Scarecrow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|For a living scarecrow, he's not too lively.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Good. He's still sleeping. We have to move fast.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Okay, but what should we do?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Watch me!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I'm gonna need a boost!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley and Lily|Ahh! Ahh! He's coming! Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|What a bunch of chickens!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Mona the Vampire—ha! Wait'll everyone at school hears about this. They'll be—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela and George|The Living Scarecrow! Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Alistair|Uh, just wondering whether you know of any part-time jobs in town. Hello?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|And zombies look like this! Rgh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|This is gonna be harder than I thought. The Living Scarecrow could be my greatest foe yet!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Living Scarecrow|Hahahahahahahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Reverend Gregory wants everyone in the stamp club to know that he's holding a meeting tonight at the church.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|The church is right next to the graveyard! What if we run into the Living Scarecrow?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Mona, you know the rules! No vampires in the classroom!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|But, Miss Gotto, how else am I supposed to save the town from the Living Scarecrow?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Mona, I've had enough of—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hiya!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|Oof!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|The Living Scarecrow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Settle down! Please! Class!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|All right, Living Scarecrow! I'm not done with you yet.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|Oh...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Uh... Good morning, Principal Shawbly.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|Now if I started allowing vampires in the classroom, what would be next? Werewolves? Ghoulie-ghouls?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I could get rid of them for you.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Mona, don't you have something to say to Principal Shawbly?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I'm sorry I mistook you for the Living Scarecrow and whacked you with the door. It won't happen again.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|Yes, well, see that it doesn't.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Living Scarecrow|Huahahahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Mom! Where's the salt?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|On the counter by the sink!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Do we have any garlic?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|In the fridge with the Spanish onions! Why?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Let's see—garlic for the Living Scarecrow, and salt for the zombies. I'm going to bring the Spanish onion, just in case. There's no telling what we'll run into out there.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|This town is swimming with zombies!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Eat salt, zombies!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Living Scarecrow|Huahahahahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|After him, Fang!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Living Scarecrow|Hahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|These are the only shoes like this in the whole country. Watch! Aren't they fabulous?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Reverend Gregory|Very nice, Angela. Now, getting back to the real reason we're here tonight—stamps!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Watch them undo themselves now!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|The Living Scarecrow's outside!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|I don't want to be a zombie!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Agh! Agh! Agh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|George is a zombie! Run!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Zapman, you go left. Princess Giant, you go right. I'll go up the middle. Angela, George, you stay here.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela and George|Phew!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|You'll be the bait.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela and George|We don't want to be the bait!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|In there!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|I can't mingle with garbage. I'm rich!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela and George|The Living Scarecrow! Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Reverend Gregory|Children? I'm going to start the stamp club meeting without you! I've got a new holographic triangle stamp from Paraguay!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Prepare to spring the trap, fellow monster-crushers! I'll go flush him out!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Uh-oh! Smells like trouble!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Living Scarecrow|Huahaha! Huahaha! Hahahahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hee! Ha! Ho! Ha! The brain buffet is closed, buddy! Take that! And this!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Living Scarecrow|Hahahahaha! Ahahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I guess this stuff only works on zombies. Then how about some garlic!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Living Scarecrow|Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Unh! Mega-creep energy field! Hard to move! Fang! Help!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Good work, Fang! Look, he lost his hat! He's powerless without it! Go get his hat while I distract him.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hey, you big bag of hay, what's the matter? Did I knock the stuffing out of you?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Take this Spanish onion.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|He's headed towards the net. Come on, Fang, let's hurry!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|All right! They caught him!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Good work, team!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Reverend Gregory! And the Living Scarecrow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Reverend Gregory|This is Alistair, the new gardener, young man. I just hired him.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Alistair|How do?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona, Charley, and Lily|Oh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Fear not, team! The Living Scarecrow may have eluded our trap, but without this, he won't bother anyone anymore!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|All right! The hat!}}
{{ft|Charley|Wow! Great!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Reverend Gregory|No, Mona. I think that's Alistair's hat.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Alistair|Actually, my hat's right over here.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Reverend Gregory|Yes. What say we conclude this meeting of the stamp club with some milk and cookies?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|The Living Scarecrow may be neutralized, but there's still plenty of ghosts and creepy-crawlies and ghoulie-ghouls waiting for Mona the Vampire! But they can wait till after snacktime. Come on, Fang!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Is it safe to come out yet?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Shh! It'll hear us!}}
}}

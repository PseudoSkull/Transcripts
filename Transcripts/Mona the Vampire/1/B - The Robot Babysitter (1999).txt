{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|What do you want for breakfast, sweetheart?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|The usual—fried brains and blood.}}
}}

{{ft/i|VONK}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Brains and ketchup coming up!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Breakfast is served!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|There are grasshoppers in my food. I hate grasshoppers in my food.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Those are green onions.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|All right. One order of brains and blood, hold the grasshoppers.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Thanks, Dad.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|By the way, your mother and I have decided to go out for a nice romantic evening.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Really? Where are we going?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Well, actually, you're not going anywhere. Mom and I are going out for dinner.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|So I get to stay home all alone?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Uh, no. We got you a babysitter.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|A babysitter? Dad, you're talking to a kid who's stopped three alien invasions, captured a runaway mummy, and defeated Von Kreepsula, the king vampire, all in one month. I think I can take care of myself.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|I hear she babysits your school friend, Angela Smith. You'll have lots to talk about.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Angela Smith isn't my friend. Dad, she's my most hated enemy and rival. She's evil personified in a spring designer smock.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Now what kind of a babysitter could handle Angela? She can't be human.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Smith|Angela! Your babysitter's here!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Hi, sweetie. Bye, sweetie. Have a nice day.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I'm not hungry. I'm going to school now.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Not dressed like that you're not. Get upstairs and change, young lady.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|It's kind of hard to be a monster-buster with your Mom always telling you what to do, you know!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|So instead of letting me stay home alone, they got me a babysitter, and not just any babysitter. She's Angela's babysitter.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Angela's babysitter?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow. Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|What kind of sitter could handle Angela? She can't be human!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|I won't finish my string beans! I won't! I won't! I won't! I won't!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Well, no matter how monstrous the babysitter, she'll be no match for Mona the Vampire!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Ha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Oh. Hello, Angela.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|For your information, Belinda the babysitter is more than a match for Mona the Vampire. She's worse than your worst nightmare. You don't stand a chance.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Oh, hi, Mom.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Is something the matter?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Don't worry about me, Mom. Go out and have fun. I'll be...fine.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Hmm... Well, maybe I should take your temperature.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I already did.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|150 degrees?}}
}}

{{ft/i|{{c|150<br><br>140}}}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Is that bad?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|I hope this isn't my mascara.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Look, Mom! The gardening channel is doing a special on perennials. Wouldn't want to miss that, now would you?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Nice try, Mona.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Dad, can you stay home and help me with my math homework? Please?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Sorry, sweetheart. Your mother and I are going out tonight.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Oh! That must be your babysitter.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Don't do it, Dad! Who knows what horrific creature stands behind that door!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Ahh! Oh.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Hi! I'm Belinda.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Pleased to meet you, Belinda. This is Mona.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Oh, hi, Belinda.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Feel free to help yourself to anything in the fridge.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Have a good night.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda and Mona|Goodbye!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Handling her should be no problem at all.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Belinda's rules: number one—no screaming; number two—no running; number three—no talking back; number four—all homework must be completed before TV-viewing; number five—bedtime is at 10:00 sharp; number six—where's the telephone?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Thank you.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Looks like I'm gonna need some backup after all.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|<nowiki>1: 3x + 4y = 7x. 2: 5x - 2y = 4x.</nowiki>}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I'll get it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hey, Zapman! Hi, Princess Giant! You got here just in time. That's her.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|That's her?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|She's not human, that's for sure, but I don't quite know what she is.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|My guess is alien shapeshifter.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Well, there's only one way to find out. Time for some secret surveillance.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Aha! Our first clue!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Looks like a spring from a busted pen.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|No. This is no ordinary spring.}}
}}

{{ft/i|{{c|OIL}}}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Clue number two—the oil.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|But wasn't she using the oil for her salad?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|That's exactly what she wants us to think. After all, what kind of teenager eats salad for a snack?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|The spring, the oil, the radio-wave instructions... Suddenly, it all makes sense.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|It does?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Yes! Belinda is a robot, and the worst kind of robot—she's under Angela's control!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|So what do we do?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Let's see, how do they stop robots in the movies?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Sometimes, they use water to short-circuit them.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|That's it! We'll short-circuit her.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Whoopsy!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Agh! That water is freezing!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Sorry, I tripped.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Rule number 27—do not spill anything on the babysitter!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|She obviously is receiving radio-wave instructions from Angela, so all we have to do is scramble the frequency.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Huh?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Agh! Mona! Rule number 33—all excessive noise is prohibited!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Okay, this never fails in the movies. I'm going to override her circuitry with an electrical short.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|You're going to electrocute her?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Close.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Agh! That does it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|The robot babysitter's out of control! Run for your lives!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|All right. Angela has set the robot babysitter on seek-and-destroy mode. That means she's going to try to separate us, picking us off one by one. So we have to stick together, no matter what!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley and Lily|Okay, deal!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Rule number 42—misbehaving friends must leave, or else!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Bye, Mona.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|See you tomorrow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Wait here, young lady.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Okay, Fang, no more Miss Nice Vampire. It's time to go with plan Z!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|It's really simple, Fang. Since Angela is controlling the robot babysitter by remote control, all I have to do is override her signal with my own remote control unit. This TV remote will do the job. Now, with a little bit of retuning, I'll control Belinda's robotic brainwaves. That way, she'll be my robot instead of Angela's.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow! Meowowow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|She's coming!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Almost there. Almost... I've nearly got it...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Mona?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|It's working!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Mona, you are one funny little girl, and it's kind of hard to stay mad at you, even though I have every right to be.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|I think we got off on the wrong foot. Now, I don't want you to think I'm being too harsh with you, but after everything Angela told me about you...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|What Angela told you about me? What did she say?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|She said you'd be trouble and warned me to be really strict with you.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|She did?!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Well, you haven't exactly proven her wrong.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Angela told me that you were a nightmare.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|She did?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|You know, I bet there's tons of stuff you don't know about Angela that you might find very interesting.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Angela's not allergic to broccoli. She just says that to get out of eating her veggies.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Really?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|And if she ever tells you that we have computer class homework, don't believe her. She uses that as an excuse to go up to her room and play video games.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|She does?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Are you storing all this information away in your memory banks?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|You bet.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|We're home!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|I hope you-know-who behaved.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda and Mona|She did!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Belinda|Thanks for everything. Nice meeting you, Mona. Goodbye!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Goodbye, Belinda. Goodnight.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|What in the—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|And after I did her hair and makeup, we stayed up and watched the late-night creature feature—''Bride of the Monster with the Webbed Feet''.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|What did you do to my babysitter? I can't get away with anything now! She knows all my secrets!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|She's not your babysitter anymore. She's my babysitter.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|How did you turn the robot babysitter around?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Well, let's just say I had her reprogrammed.}}
}}

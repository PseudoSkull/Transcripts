=="The Dreaded Human Spider"==
* Of Herb Crofton's line "Meet a friend of mine, the giant actaeon beetle from South America." — He is clearly talking about the actaeon beetle, but pronounces it as /ˈæsɛtɑn/, which is incorrect.
* Of Mona's line "Attention, all shoppers—please report any sightings of a giant five-and-a-half-foot insect immediately to 'frightened kabushnu.'" — Through some editing of the line with Audacity, the closest thing that can be heard is something that sounds like "frightened /kæbʊʃnu/." It is imperative to flirt with the possibility that the sound of the shoppers screaming could be cleanly isolated from Mona's voice using a sound editing application such as Audacity, but previous attempts to do so have been unsuccessful. Some theories include:
:* This part of Mona's line isn't supposed to be heard over the screaming shoppers, which is more important to the episode's plot. This suggests it could just be nonsensical rambling, especially if the voice actress knew ahead of time that this was the part that wouldn't be heard.
:* The above theory is problematic, however, because other similar lines in the series, when listened to closely, can be positively identified as coherent English words, such as in one of Ned Naderson's lines that was spoken over in "The Whirling Void."
:* Given the context, Mona was probably mentioning the name of some authority to whom the threat of a giant bug should be reported. Whether this authority was the proper name of an organization or a combination of common nouns and possibly adjectives has not been determined.
:* The possibility of the first element of the rambling being "flight one" (as in, the first flight of stairs in Gold's Grocery), instead of the more accepted "frightened" theory, has been speculated.

{{ft|Miss Gotto|Principal Shawbly has informed me that this year, the school would like to do something a little different for our annual fundraiser.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Hey! What happened to selling pens door-to-door? I'm the pen king!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|We do the door-to-door pen sale every year, and, quite frankly, Charley, everyone in town is sick of pens! Now, we need something more exciting, more vibrant!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|More vibrant than pens?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Yes, Charley, even more vibrant than pens. Now, what would you all like to do for a fundraiser this year? Any suggestions?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Charley?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|How about—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|We are not selling pencils door-to-door either!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Oh...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Anyone else?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Boy|A talent show!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|A concert!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|A celebrity monster roast!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Students|Ahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|I have a reasonable suggestion, Miss Gotto. What about a fashion show? All the kids can make their own clothes, and we can give out prizes.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|What a good idea, Angela! But we'll need someone to judge the event.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|How about famed supermodel Tiffany S. Tyk? By an incredible stroke of good fortune, she's in town, attending a distant relative's funeral.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|My! That is a stroke of luck, but are you sure we can get her?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Oh, absolutely! My father's accountant golfs with her accountant's father. We're practically related.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|A fashion show it is, and you're in charge, Angela!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|And Charley, you're responsible for the advertising. Lily—refreshments. And Mona—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Save your breath! If you're gonna boss people around, I'm not gonna have anything to do with your silly fashion show.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|I'm not surprised. It's painfully obvious that you have no fashion sense whatsoever.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|There's nothing wrong with what I wear. And even if there was, I don't care what people think.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Well, I care. I wanna wear something extra special for the fashion show. Something like that!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Extra special? I guess that's one way of putting it. What are you doing?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Sketching. I wanna come up with a design that'll knock Tiffany S. Tyk's socks off!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|It is not possible! No one is buying my Beautiful Like Me line of clothes! The Maison de Murray is no longer the toast of this town's fashion community. And why? I mean, what idiot would not love to wear these clothes?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Ta-da! I'm even more beautiful! I must have this outfit, Mother!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|But how is this possible? I cannot blame myself, for I...I am a genius.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|No, it must be these inadequate mannequins! They are to blame! You—gather the mannequins! They need to be reformed.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lady|Uh, yes, Monsieur Murray.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|This is going to be great!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|If you say so.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Gasp! My dress!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Thank goodness it's okay!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I've gotta be honest, Lily. I don't think that dress will ever be okay.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|What?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Where did the mannequin go?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Gasp! There! She's alive, flesh and bones—a living mannequin!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|And she's going into the nonfat simulated yogurt shop.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Her bad taste doesn't end at clothes. Come on!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|What are you doing?!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|I've gotta finish my sketch of that dress.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|A living mannequin is in our midst, and you're worried about your fashion show outfit?! Just look at her, trying to be inconspicuous.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|She doesn't want anyone to know her true identity, so she's trying to act as normal as possible.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|There's something weird going on here, and we're gonna find out what.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|I'm going to copy this dress, and be the hit of the fashion show.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|You were right, Mona. This was a dumb idea.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|Come here, my beauty. The resistance is futile.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona and Lily|Gasp! Gasp!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|Soon, I will be the master once again.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|It's all becoming clear. He's creating an invincible army of living mannequins. He'll use them to take over the fashion world!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Then how come he's melting them down?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Those are rebel mannequins—mannequins who refused to do his bidding—so he's having them replaced.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Gasp! Then the one we saw in the yogurt shop...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Obviously, she escaped his evil clutches and is now on the run. We have to help her!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Mona! Help!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hang on, Lily! Pfft!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Take that! Ha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Aha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Whoa! Whoa! Unh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Uh-oh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Yeah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Yippee! Woohoo! Yeah! I got it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona and Lily|Hahahahahaha! Hahahaha! Haha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|What in the world?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Murray's mannequin army will soon make its move, Fang. But when? Where?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Here you go, Mona, even if you're not gonna be in the fashion show.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|The Maison de Murray is sponsoring the fashion show? Charley, do you know what this means?!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|No.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|It means that's where Murray will let loose his mannequin army! We're doomed! Charley, what would you rather do—help with the fashion show, or do battle with the evil Murray Karpowicz?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|When you put it that way...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Okay, everyone, clear out! Monsieur Murray has a big surprise for the fashion show, so no one—absolutely no one—is allowed to watch him unload his truck!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|He's making his move.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Ow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|Hahahahahaha! I am a genius! I am a creator! Gosh, I'm good.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|You are wacko, buddy!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|The world will be in awe!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Now to find out what all the secrecy's about.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Gasp!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Gasp!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona, Charley, and Lily|Gasp!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|So that's Murray's plan. He's going to replace the entire town with living mannequins, but he's neglected to consider one important factor—Mona the Vampire!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Miss Tiffany S. Tyk, thank you for agreeing to be our judge!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiffany S. Tyk|How could I say no, especially since I found out your father's accountant golfs with my accountant's father? We're practically related, Nancy.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Uh, my name is Angela.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|Aha! I've found you at last!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiffany S. Tyk|Let's move things along, dear. I have a Paris fitting in 12 hours.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|I'm on it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|Nuh-uh-uh-uh! Not so fast! Where do you think you're going?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiffany S. Tyk|Away from you!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|Wait! There's something I must show you! They're my new designs. I call it the Plain Like You line.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiffany S. Tyk|Indeed.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|It's wonderful! Just imagine yourself in something like this! Ahem, uh, wrong one! Here, let me—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiffany S. Tyk|I do not wear anything plain.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|No! Come back! Wait!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Gasp!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|I am your master! You will obey me, or be destroyed!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiffany S. Tyk|Help! Help! I want to be free!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|We're not gonna let you enslave that living mannequin, or anyone else in this town, without a fight! Gotcha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|Eeh! Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiffany S. Tyk|Oh, thank you! You saved me!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Not yet. I've still gotta put you back together.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiffany S. Tyk|We're doomed!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Do you mind if I borrow these?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiffany S. Tyk|Be my guest.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona, Charley, and Lily|Yah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Hiya!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Wah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Yah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hiya! Ha! Ha! Ho! Ha! Ho! Ha! Ho! Hiya!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Let the show... Uh... Let the show begin!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Ugh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Well, despite your best efforts, Mona, my fashion show was a success.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiffany S. Tyk|I don't know what happened to Monsieur Murray, but he could certainly learn a thing or two about fashion from...Mona!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiffany S. Tyk|This look is so unique, so different!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Thanks. I'm sorry about your friends, but at least you're free to live a normal life.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiffany S. Tyk|Uh, well, thanks, Mona.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Another job well done.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Monsieur Murray|Wait! Miss Tiffany! Somebody help!}}
}}

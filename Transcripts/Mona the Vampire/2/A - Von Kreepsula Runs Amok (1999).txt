{{ft|Mona|Dear vampire diary,

A great man once said that comic books offer a world of color and wonder, but they conceal a dark side of shadows and fear. I think it was Churchill, or maybe my uncle Waldo—he hates comics.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Ahh! Rgh!}}
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Anyway, it's the perfect introduction to an absolutely scarilicious adventure I like to call "Von Kreepsula Runs Amok."}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Comic book conventions are the best! Where else can you find so many famous people in one room?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Yeah! We've met Captain Alabaster, Fancy Cape Man, Mole Boy, Squirrel Girl... Oh! Back issues of my favorite comic book team—''The Double Y Men''! ''Double Y Men Adventure Classics''! Oh! A new title—''Favorite Forgotten Recipes of the Double Y Men''!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Zapman, it's him!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|And before anyone could say, "Look out, kid, you're stepping on my comics..."}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Comic book convention employee|Look out, kid, you're stepping on my comics! Wah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Walter Fishman|Creepiest regards from Von Kreepsu—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hyah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Walter Fishman|Wah! Ahh! Get off me, kid! If you want an autograph, stand in line like everyone else!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hey! You're not my main nemesis and most hated rival, Von Kreepsula, king of the evil vampires.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Walter Fishman|No! I'm Walter Fishman, an actor hired to wear this suit and sell the new Von Kreepsula toyline.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Oh... Sorry about that.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Walter Fishman|I should just stick to dinner theater.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|It's probably not the first time he's been mistaken for the real thing. I'm sure he's got people trying to stick stakes through his heart all the time.}}
}}

{{ft/i|VONK}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|''Von Kreepsula'' number one, in mint condition! It must be worth a fortune.}}
}}

{{ft/i|Y}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|How much? I wanna buy it for my best buddy, here!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|No, Charley, I—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Comic book convention salesman|$150, or we could work out a trade. I see you collect ''The Unusual Double Y Men''. Have any old issues?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|I've got them all—''Giant Size Unusual Double Y Men'' number one, ''Double Y Men'' 94 to 100.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Comic book convention salesman|Deal!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Well, uh, I didn't really want to trade all my comics.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Forget it, Charley. You don't need to get me ''Von Kreepsula'' number one. I already have it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|You do? I have to see it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|This is where I keep my most prized possessions; like my diary; my vampire-vision glasses; a ball of 100-year-old bubblegum, rumored to contain a werewolf's tooth; and the very first issue of ''Von Kreepsula'', in mint condition, sealed in plastic.}}
}}

{{ft/i|VONK}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|I have to read it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Well, uh, it's not that I don't trust you to take care of it, Charley. But, uh, you see, I wouldn't want to accidentally release the evil Von Kreepsula from his comic-book prison.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Huh?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Ages ago, I dueled the dreaded Von Kreepsula in the ultimate battle of good versus evil vampires.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Von Kreepsula|Huahahahaha! Huahahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Take that, King Creepy!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Von Kreepsula|Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I imprisoned him in his comic-book world, the gateway to which just happens to be this issue of ''Von Kreepsula'' number one.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Huh? Gee, Mona. I thought we were best buddies. But I guess if you don't trust me...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|No, Charley, I do trust you. It's just that, well, uh... Here! Bring it back tomorrow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Wow! Do you really mean it? I'm going home to read it right away!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Take your time. And don't worry, 'cause I sure won't!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I really shouldn't be worried. I mean, what's the worst that could happen?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bones|Charles! It's for you. And after you're done, could you tidy up a bit?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Hello?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hiya, Charley. How are you enjoying the comic book?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|I'm just about to start reading it.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Well, just wanted to remind you that the print on the page is very delicate, and the natural oils from your fingers could corrode it.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Okay, okay, I'll wear gloves.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Ah, don't worry, Fang. Charley's my best buddy. He'll make sure nothing happens to my comic!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bones|Charles, it's for you!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Hello? Hello?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Just wanted to remind you to put it back in the plastic when you're done. Bye!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bones|Charles, why don't you go outside and get some fresh air?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Okay, Mom.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bones|Charles, lunchtime!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|I'm not hungry!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bones|I made your favorite, franks and beans!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Sudden thunderstorms are usually a sign of trouble. Hmm... I wonder if this has anything to do with Von Kreepsula. I'd better go over to Charley's place and come up with a plan, just in case, and, while I'm there, pick up my comic book.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Mm... Hi, Mona. What are you doing here?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I've got a feeling Von Kreepsula is planning an escape from his comic-book world. We need to come up with a plan, and I need to get my comic book back.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Your comic book? Oh no!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Mona, I'm really sorry! I didn't mean to wreck your comic book.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Charley, do you realize what you've done?! Not only did you ruin my most prized thing in the whole world, but by letting the ink run out of the comic book, you released Von Kreepsula from his prison into our world!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Unh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Where are you going?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I have to recapture Von Kreepsula.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|I'll come too! I can help you.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|No thanks, Charley. Obviously I can't trust you anymore.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|What about your comic book?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Keep it. It's useless now!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I hurried home for a quick equipment check.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Fangs—check! Vampire-vision glasses—check! Pocket light—check!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Mona, it's Charley!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Tell him I'm busy! Come on, Fang.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Sorry, Charley, she, uh, just stepped out. Can I leave her a message?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Uh, no thanks.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I started my hunt for Von Kreepsula by going to the most obvious place—the park.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|If he wants revenge, this is where he'll come looking for me.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hmm... Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he isn't interested in revenge after all.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Von Kreepsula|Mona the Vampire, we meet again. Hahahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bones|Charles, dear, would you like some ice cream? Oh, the little sweetheart tidied up after all!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Comic book convention salesman|Hi, there. Changed your mind about the trade?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Meanwhile, I was confronting Von Kreepsula. In the first stage of our duel, we did battle on the monkey bars of doom! Then we exchanged vampire blasts on the swing sets of chaos! Then we tried to outlast each other on the merry-go-whirl of havoc!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Whoa! Oof!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Von Kreepsula|So, the best vampire has finally won! Prepare to meet your doom!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Von Kreepsula|No! A brand new copy of ''Von Kreepsula'' number one!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Help!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Hang on, Mona! I've got you!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona and Charley|Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|And just like that, we had entered the comic-book world.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Von Kreepsula|Welcome to my world. Hahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/i|ZZZZZZZZ}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hey!}}
}}

{{ft/i|ZO [...] ZZZ

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|What's going on?}}
}}

{{ft/i|!!}}

{{ft/i|ZZZULAAAA}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Von Kreepsula|You are trapped—trapped forever! Hahahahahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/i|RRRRR

AH}}

{{ft/i|RRR}}

{{ft/i|PLAC!}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Then it's over! We've lost!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Not yet, because there's something Von Kreepsula didn't count on—my secret anti-evil vampire pocket light.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Von Kreepsula|Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/i|!!!}}

{{ft/i|AAHHH!!}}

{{ft/i|VVZZZZ}}

{{ft/i|BADABOUM}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Whoa!}}
}}

{{ft/i|BADABOUM}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Gah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Thanks, Charley. If it wasn't for you, I don't know what would have happened.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|No problem. After all, what are friends for? So, what do you wanna do now?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|You can come to my house and watch ''Attack of the Slime Munch'' for the zillionth time.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Sounds like a plan!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|And so ended my second meeting with the nefarious Von Kreepsula. Well, diary, that's all for now. Till next time. Goodnight!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}

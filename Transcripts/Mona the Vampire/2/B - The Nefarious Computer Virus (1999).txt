{{ft|Mona|I'm worried about Zapman. He's been late for school every day this week, and he didn't show up for our field trip yesterday.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Do you think he may have been kidnapped by pirates?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Regular pirates? No way. Only interstellar space buccaneers could keep Zapman from visiting the Insectodome. It's possible he contracted galactic bacteria while we were rescuing the white dwarves on Marzink 7. That'd keep him in bed for a while!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Or maybe his alias Charley is busy doing homework.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Charley, studying? I don't think so.}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow! Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|My vampire senses tell me there's something weird going on with Charley.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bones|Charles, turn out your light!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|If Charley's late for school again, he's in big trouble, and I mean big trouble!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|Indeed! Very big trouble, indeed!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Uh...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Good morning, Principal Shawbly. Lovely day!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|Good morning. Now, off to class, you two!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|I smell a tardy slip.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Class, this is a computer. Now, the first thing you do when engaging yourself with a computer is turn it on!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Mm, the on button has to be here somewhere...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Charley, you're late—fourth time this week! I suggest you go have a chat with Principal Shawbly.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Uh-oh.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Yes, Miss Gotto.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Class, back to work!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Look, everyone! Look! I bet I look even more beautiful on a computer screen than in real life!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Wow, Angela, I bet it's like looking into a mirror!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|Late every day this week! I assume you have a good explanation!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Uh, well, it's that, uh, I slept in, because I was up very late playing ''Star Clangers 2''.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|''Star Clangers 2''? What on earth?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|It's the greatest computer game in the world!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|Oh? Give it to me!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|When you beat the game, a super fantastic secret ending is revealed.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|A super fantastic top secret ending, you say?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Charley is still in Principal Shawbly's office.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Something weird is going on here.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|That is quite a game, Charley!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|No one has ever come back from Principal Shawbly's office with a smile before.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|See you tomorrow, maybe? Huh? Hahahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hey, Charley, wanna come help us stop another white-dwarf UFO invasion over at city hall?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|He looked right through us.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|It's as if we weren't even here!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|If he was in his right mind, Charley would never do that.}}
}}

{{ft/i|{{c|BAZ AAR}}}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Something's gotten into Charley, but what? What?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Adventure time out! I wanna pick up the ''Star Clangers 2'' game. It's supposed to have a brilliant ending!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|My dad says computer games are a waste of time.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Dad, what are you doing here?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Oh, hi, sweetie. I just dropped by to pick up a copy of ''Star Clangers 2''.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|But, Dad, you don't like computer games.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Oh, well, uh... Gotta run, see you at home!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Computer store salesman|Here it is. Would you like anything else with that? Maybe a Buzzomedia Megacoproducer with 38 DTIs?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Just the game, please.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Computer store salesman|Uh, hey, how about a Skinny Scan 27,000 with a Computer Virus Eradicator as a throw-in?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Mona, is it just me, or does everyone look like they've stayed up all night playing computer games?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|No, they look like they've contracted some horrible virus—a computer virus that turns them into computer pod people!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona and Lily|Ahh! Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Phew! Good thing the Cyber Café was so close. Oh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I hope this place has takeout, because we've gotta run!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|We made it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona and Lily|Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Mom, Dad, the whole town is crawling with pod people! Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Oh, hi, honey. Care to join us in a little game of ''Star Clangers 2''?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Fun for the whole family!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Oh, no!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Mom and Dad are infected, Fang! It's gotta be that dumb ''{{SIC|Star Clanger|Star Clangers}} 2'' computer game. And it's up to you, me, and Lily to save the town from—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Oh, no! She bought a copy of the game. Quick, to the hotline!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Princess Giant isn't answering. She must be in trouble! Emergency!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Bye, Mom, Dad, or whoever you think you are...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Bye, honey. Don't be late.}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|I can't wait to try out this game!}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Quick, Fang!}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|''Star Clangers 2'' narrator|If you make it past the final level, a wonderful surprise awaits you.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Here we go!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Lily, no! Lily, it's a trap! Stop the game!}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|''Star Clangers 2'' narrator|Congratulations! Keep going.}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Lily, no!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Mona?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|''Star Clangers 2'' narrator|You lost! You cannot know the secret.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Huh? Hey! I wanted to figure out the super surprise ending!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I'll tell you the big secret. Right at the very end of the game, the super fantastic surprise is that the game infects your brain, and the player becomes a pod person forever!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|But that's horrible! How do we stop it?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I have a plan! Follow me!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Computer store salesman|Hello, ladies. And what can I do for you today?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|We need something to get rid of a computer virus that's infecting people's brains.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Computer store salesman|The humanoid hard drive... Hm... How about a 3ZZ Viral Destructo? Or, we've got the ever-effective Destructor DDT, and the Eradicator.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|We'll take them all, and one scanner, and one Super Mega Ultra Power Water Zap Gun.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Computer store salesman|We don't carry water zap guns.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|What? And you call this a computer store?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Computer store salesman|Oh, but I have got something else—a Computerized Super Mega Ultra Power Twin Carbine Water Ray Gun.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|We'll take everything! We're gonna need it.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|We have to find the very first ''{{SIC|Star Clanger|Star Clangers}} 2'' game in town, and eradicate the virus inside. But who would have it?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Hm... The first game in town... Wouldn't that be Charley?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Of course! Charley's always the first one to get all the new games!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Mona, aren't we gonna need those for Charley's computer?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Exactly! I'm reformatting these CD-ROMs, liquifying their antivirus, um, components. Then, I'll suck them up in their liquified state.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|We may have lost him forever. Quick, plug in the scanner!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|It's plugged in.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Are you ready?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|I guess.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|And now me.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Everything is going according to plan.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Let's go!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Uh-oh! Giant alien squid!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|They got Fang! It's party time, dancing squiddies!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Come on! Let's go attack the undefeatable alien mother ship.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Do we have to?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Yup.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Ooh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Lily!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I must get to the ending before it's too late, but the alien forcefield is too strong!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Alien mother ship|You must surrender, and let your citizens become pod people!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Never!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|No! Ahh! Uh-oh! It's got me! Take that! Hahaha, gotcha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|I did it! I did it! I beat the game! I defeated the mother ship! And now for the super fantastic secret message!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|''Star Clangers 2'' narrator|Congratulations! You've beaten ''Star Clangers 2''. The fantastic secret message is..."to be continued." Watch for ''Star Clangers 3'', coming soon to a store near you. Order yours now!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|What a rip-off! It was supposed to reveal a super fantastic secret! This is the worst game in the world!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Well, at least it's better than being a pod person forever.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Boy 1|That ''Star Clangers 2'' was a total waste of time!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Boy 2|"To be continued?" Some secret hidden message. What a rip-off!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|I'm going to tell Charley a thing or two about this stupid game!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Well, after another death-defying adventure into the creepy unknown, we've saved the world again, and everything seems back to normal. No one will be staying up all night playing this computer game anymore.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Now I can find out what all the big hullabaloo is about the super fantastic secret ending to ''Star Clangers 2'', hahaha! Now, where is that on button? How do you turn this thing on?!}}

{{ft|Mona|Hello? Greetings? Anyone out there? This is Mona the Vampire and Zapman of Planet Earth. Come in, alien lifeforms. We're broadcasting an intergalactic message of peace. Hello, cosmic neighbors.}}
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Okay, we'd better turn on our satellite dish receiver so the aliens can send us their response.}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Referee|It's a match three million years in the making, as Earth's champion, Lardo the Magnificent, faces the nutcase from outer space, Ikvor the Destroyer. Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/i|SPO<br>CLU}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Ikvor the Destroyer|No puny human can match my superior alien strength and fighting prowess. Lardo the Magnificent is finished!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Ikvor the Destroyer|I have vanquished warriors from all over the galaxy. Today, I will become the undisputed champion of the universe! Prepare for the worst! Rah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Wow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Referee|Alright, let's start the match.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Well, Zapman, it looks like we've got a full-scale alien invasion on our hands.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Wow, third one this month! It must be the high season.}}
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Look, Fang!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|It's the landing runway for the alien spacecrafts!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|And here comes the advanced spaceship from the alien invasion fleet.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Of course I'm sure!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Construction worker|Okay, let's get to work!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Then while I was investigating the runway, I saw one of their advanced scoutships flying. That alien scout will be gathering information right under our noses, so keep your eyes open for any unusual-looking characters.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Pip pip! Hello! Morning! Hello!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|I'd like you all to meet someone who has travelled a long way to pay us a visit. Let's have a big Saint Faith's "hello" for Cedric Lewis!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Students|Hi, Cedric! Hi! Hi! Hello!}}
{{ft|Lily|Hello, Cedric!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hmm... Kind of unusual looking. Let's keep an eye on him!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Wow! He eats more than my dad!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hmm... It's a known fact that aliens generally consume five times their body weight.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Coincidence?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Maybe. Maybe not.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|What's he reaching for?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|It's...it's...a spoon?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|It looks like an ordinary spoon, but it could be a cleverly disguised alien communicator. He could be contacting his home world as we speak!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Pip pip, pip. Pip pip pip pip pip, pip pip. Pip pip pip pip pip, pip pip. Pip pip.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Sneaky...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Creepy...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Weird...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|No sign of that alien out here.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Pip pip!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona, Charley, and Lily|Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Would you care to play a game?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|What did you have in mind?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Cricket, anyone?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|How about it?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Look out! He's got a Venusian paddle blaster!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Get him!}}
}}

{{ft/i|COSMU}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Yah!}}
{{ft|Lily|Yah!}}
{{ft|Mona|Let's exterminate this alien vermin!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Wah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona, Charley, and Lily|Unh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Mona! Do you want to cause an international incident?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|No, no, my fault. They simply misinterpreted me. I just wanted to know if they wanted to play cricket.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hello? This is Planet Earth, not some weird alien world. We don't play cricket here!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Mona, don't be rude! We'd love to learn how to play!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Well, it's quite simple, really. The team that is out tries to get the team that is in out.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|The team that is out goes in, and the in team becomes the team that is out. Now, the really interesting part is...}}
{{ft|Lily|It's like he's making it up as he goes along.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Outs are in. They try to stay in as long as possible.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|The team that is out goes in.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Oh, no time for games! Back to class!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|There's no doubt about it now—that kid is definitely from another planet!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Pip pip, pip!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|That little alien has to be stopped!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|If only we knew where he was staying tonight.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Bye!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Bye!}}
{{ft|Lily|Seeya!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Keep an eye out for that alien.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Mona, the school called, and—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|It wasn't me! That chemistry experiment was like that when I got there!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|No, no. The school called to ask if we'd mind showing a guest a little hospitality.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Pip pip. Hello, Mona!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|I bet things are very different where you come from.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Oh, indeed!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|It's like a whole different planet!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Hahaha! Ahahaha! Hahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Here's a fork.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|No, thank you. I have my own.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Ah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Be warned—the alien invasion force will take over your world, and put your brains on display!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Did you say something, Cedric?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|What's this?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Lettuce, for a salad.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Salad? We don't eat that where I come from.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Is Cedric still in the washroom?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|He's been in there for hours, Mom! Don't you find that a little suspicious?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|It's only been 10 minutes. He's probably just brushing his teeth.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Or brushing his scaly green tail.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Oh, sorry.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Nighty night.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Goodnight.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Pip, pip. Pip pip pip pip, pip. Pip pip, pip, pip. Pip pip pip pip, pip. Pip, pip pip, pip, pip, pip pip.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Now I've got you!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Not yet!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Alright, that does it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Mona!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|It's the middle of the night. What are you doing?!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Well...I...uh...you see... Sigh... I was going to zap this alien into a parallel universe!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Back to bed!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|But...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Yeah, okay...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|ZRX 9! ZRX 9! This is Cedric 5, reporting. Come in, ZRX 9!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|By the way, I'm onto you! I know you're really an alien!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Well, I'm onto you! I know you're really a vampire! Well, I'm done. See you at school.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|It's so nice to see the two of you getting along so well.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Rgh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|That's advanced alien know-how for you. And not only did he invade my dreams, but he figured out my secret identity.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Uh-oh! It's the first wave! The alien invasion has begun!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|They've sent to the robodroids to soften us up! Run!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Down here!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|The planet's in danger. This is a job for Mona the Vampire!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|There he is!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|He's downloading information so that the invasion force will know where to strike!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|We've got to stop him before his big alien brain sucks up all Earth's information!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Let's get him!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Watch out!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Ahh!}}
{{ft|Lily|Eeh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Now it's your turn!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Argh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Try this vampire bolt on for size!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Why don't you try this alien bolt?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Ha! Take that!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hiya! Unh! Hiya!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Must maintain alien energy field...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Must maintain vampire energy field...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Let's see what he's hiding in his schoolbag!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Hey, that's mine! Put it down!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|He's got an alien ray blaster, Cosmic Cubie snack treats, and a space costume, and—aha—the alien invasion plans!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|No, that's my journal!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|"Things to do today—send Earth postcard to Mom and Dad, back home on...ZRX 9? ...Make friends with Mona, and ask her to help defeat the invading Zittamies from Quadrant Five Zillion Point 5."}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|You mean you're not trying to invade us? You're actually—}}
{{ft|Mona|A good alien?!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Of course I'm a good alien, just like you're a good vampire! You're not the only one with a secret identity. I've travelled billions of miles to come here and help you stop the Zittamies. They've taken over your downtown core, disguised as parking meters.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Yeah, I've seen them—hundreds of them—just standing there, looking right at you! Truce?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Friends.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hiya! Ha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cedric|Take that!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Ha!}}
}}

{{ft|Ned Naderson|This is a live on-the-scene tornado report! I'm Ned Naderson!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Mom, I tore my vampire cape saving the school from flesh-eating trolls. Can you sew it for me?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Ned Naderson|The twister is a whirling void of sound and fury that has whipped this town into a frenzy, picking up anything that isn't nailed down! But don't worry about me! Our crack news team is monitoring the situation in the KRAS-TV van, and at the first sign of trouble—}}

{{ft/i|{{c|173}}}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Ned Naderson|Agh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hey, Dad, what's a twister?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Well, uh, you see—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|What are they made of? Where do they come from? Where do they go?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|A twister is...a big whirly pool of wind with a big empty hole at its center.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Whoa!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Some of them are huge! They can suck up refrigerators, cars, sometimes even houses. And because they're made of air, they can come and go in the blink of an eye! They're whirling voids!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|A whirling void.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Honey, do you know where my other blue sock disappeared to?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Parker|Probably the same place as my sunglasses that disappeared yesterday.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Haha, yeah. Looks like we've got our own whirling void in town.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Did you hear that, Fang? A whirling void is in our town!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|So that explains what happened to my missing monster magazine, your old flea collar, and the top button from Dad's Hawaiian shirt. It all makes sense now! The whirling void took them.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Truckers|Ahh! Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Cool!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Girl|Beat you to the other side!}}
{{ft|Boy|Hey! Ahaha!}}
{{ft|Girl|Splash!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hi, Mr. Tuckerfield.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Tuckerfield|Oh, uh, hello, Bernice.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Bernice?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Yahoo!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Boy|Hahahaha! Huhuhuhu!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Tuckerfield|Good afternoon, ma'am.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|Hmm?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|My vampire towel! It's disappeared! That clinches it! There is a whirling void in town!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Ahahahaha! Hahaha! Ahahahaha! Ahahaha!}}
{{ft|Lily|Ahahahaha! Ahahaha! Ahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Nope. No. Not here.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Hey, little Miss Fancy Cape. What're you looking for? Invisible ghost ants?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|No, she's not! Are you?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|No! Actually, I'm looking for a whirling void.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|See?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|There's no such thing as a whirling void. You just made that up.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|For your information, whirling voids are big whirly pools of air. They're invisible and get around by hiding under hats, in pockets, sometimes even in water bottles. They're extremely hard to catch.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Then why are you trying to catch one?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Because one stole my vampire towel. You see, the whirling void got into the pool area by stowing away somewhere, probably in somebody's bag. Then, it sucked up my vampire towel and made good its escape by hiding inside...a bag of cheese snaps.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|That isn't what happened!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Then what did happen to my vampire towel?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Well... Uh... Well, it was obviously a...a cat burglar! He made sure no one was looking, and then he scaled the fence, spotted your towel, snatched it, and left. And that's exactly what happened.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|A cat burglar?! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|It was obviously the whirling void.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Cat burglar!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Whirling void!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Cat burglar!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Well, we're going to catch the whirling void and prove it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|No, you're not, because George and I are going to catch the cat burglar first!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|We are?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I found this at the scene of the crime.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|A restaurant menu from the Sushi Stop?}}
}}

{{ft/i|{{c|大東 流合気<br>記念 演武}}}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|The whirling void must've left it behind.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|You think whirling voids eat sushi?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Are you kidding? That's practically all they eat!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|So, Takaaki, you were saying you did have a mysterious disappearance here recently.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Takaaki|Yes, very mysterious. A pair of shoes went missing from the tatami room yesterday.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Missing shoes...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Takaaki|But, even more mysterious, another pair of shoes was left behind.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Men's pair, size 11, hopelessly out of date, and quite muddy. Very interesting. Enter this as evidence.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|I don't get it, Mona. Why would the whirling void take one pair of shoes and leave another pair behind?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|It's quite simple, really. The whirling void snuck into the restaurant and decided to sample the sushi. But in sampling the sushi, it mistakenly ate a piece of hot wasabi and coughed up the muddy pair of shoes. Before escaping, it snatched another pair of shoes and disappeared.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Charley, what kind of petal is that?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|This? It's the petal of a Rose Hill cymbidium, and only one person in town grows these flowers—Mrs. Bryerson!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Boy, we're really making progress. I wonder how Angela and George are doing.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Help! Get me down!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Ugh! Next time, I reenact the crime.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|So, Mrs. Bryerson, you didn't see anyone or anything come through your flower bed?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|No. It must have happened while I was at the salsa fest. Who do you think's responsible?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Not who, Mrs. Bryerson—what. Your flower bed was a victim of the whirling void!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|Oh, dear. Should I contact an exterminator?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Look! What do we have here?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|A beautiful silver-plated pen.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Only one place in town sells beautiful silver-plated pens.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Well, here we are, the beautiful silver-plated pen shop. Excuse me, sir. Do you recognize...this pen?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Pen salesman|Indeed. It looks just like the pen I sold Mr. Tuckerfield yesterday.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Mr. Tuckerfield?!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Pen salesman|Without a doubt. He came in here complaining about his too-tight shoes. We talked about the Japanese restaurant he'd just lunched at, then he bought this pen and left.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Too-tight shoes?! Japanese restaurant?! Think back very carefully. Did anything strange happen yesterday while Mr. Tuckerfield was here?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Pen salesman|Come to think of it, yes. A customer made a complaint about losing his wallet.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Pen salesman|Interestingly enough, I actually found a wallet a little later. Guess whose.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Mr. Tuckerfield!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Well?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Ugh! Look, this is getting us nowhere. Hang in there till tomorrow morning and the pool security will get you down.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|Ahem.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Huh?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Uh-oh! Busted.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Eheheheh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|What, may I ask, is going on here?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|We're hot on the trail of a cat burglar. He snuck in here this morning, and stole a vampire towel right off the premises!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|Vampire towel? That's funny, I saw Mr. Tuckerfield walk out of here with a vampire towel this morning.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Mr. Tuckerfield?!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Mr. Tuckerfield?! Ow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Mr. Tuckerfield was at every crime scene!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|And that can only mean one thing—the whirling void is traveling with him!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Mr. Tuckerfield! He's the cat burglar!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela, George, Mona, Charley, and Lily|Huh?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Mona?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Angela!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|There he is! Look!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela, George, Mona, Charley, and Lily|Tuckerfield!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|It's time to make a citizen's arrest!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Not so fast, burgle-guy!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Tuckerfield|Wha? What are you do— Help! Police! Help me! Help!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Nope.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Not here!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Not here!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Not here either.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Aha! I've got it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona, Charley, and Lily|Whoa!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Quick, Mona, think of something! Charley looks like he's going to be sick!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Ugh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I have an idea! We can counteract the whirling void's spinning motion by blowing against it counterclockwise! Start blowing!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|It's working! Keep blowing!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona, Charley, and Lily|We did it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Tuckerfield|What is going on here?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Shensky|Mr. Tuckerfield! Mr. Tuckerfield! You picked up the wrong glasses when you came by the store this morning. These are your glasses.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Tuckerfield|Hey! Things aren't fuzzy anymore!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Shensky|Glad to be of service.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Tuckerfield|Thank you, Mr. Shensky! Hey! These aren't my shoes!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Of course not! You cat-burglared them!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|Of course he didn't cat-burglar them, Angela. Because he had the wrong glasses on, Mr. Tuckerfield has been picking up stuff that isn't his by accident.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|No offense, Officer Halcroft, but it sounds kind of farfetched to me. I'm sticking to my theory. The whirling void may be gone, but it will return—somewhere, someplace.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|Hahaha! Whirling void.}}
}}

=="There's No Place Like Gnome"==
* Of Mrs. Bryerson's line "Oh, these Fenders don't "vo-do-de-o" like they used to, but I can fandango with the best of them.": There was [[Wiktionary:Information desk/2020/August#What did Mrs. Bryerson say here? photodiode? It was something used as a verb that sounded like "fododio"...|a discussion at Wiktionary]] about what precisely was said at this line. The is the most accepted theory is that she said "vo-do-de-o" along with a capitalized "Fender" rather than the lowercase "fender." According to the theory, "vo-do-de-o" would be a reference to that nonsensical string of syllables that was widely used in songs during the 1920s, which is when the character Mrs. Bryerson may have been younger. The proper noun Fender would reference guitars made by a certain corporation called Fender. This theory, however, is not entirely certain. Some other theories include:
:* That the "vo-do-de-o"-sounding utterance was just a made-up word that happens to sound that way.
:* That "vo-do-de-o" would be "fold olio", or some similar-sounding word before "olio" â€” The English word ''olio'', borrowed from Spanish as well as ''fandango'', a type of dance which Mrs. Bryerson also mentions, has two figurative definitions with relation to music: "A collection of various musical, theatrical or other artistic works; a miscellany." and, by extension "Vaudeville or similar miscellaneous musical or theatrical entertainment skits presented between the main acts of burlesque or minstrel shows." The ''fold'' part of the theory is problematic, though, because there are no known senses of ''fold'' that would contextually match with ''olio'' in this sentence.

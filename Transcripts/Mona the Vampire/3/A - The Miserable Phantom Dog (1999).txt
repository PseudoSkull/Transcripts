{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|What?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow! Hiss! Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Fang?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow... Meow... Meow... Meow...}}
{{ft|Fang|Meow...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Come on, Fang. It's probably just Mrs. Bryerson's poodle. What kind of a vampire sidekick are you?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|What a scaredy-cat!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Boo!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Good job, Fang! You're cured.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Hello, Mrs. Bryerson. Your poodle was making a whole lot of noise last night. Kept us all up.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|What? Oh, no, no. That wasn't Blitzie. He disappeared three days ago. I can't find him anywhere. I've looked all over town.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Disappeared?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|I'm sorry to hear that. If I see him, I'll let you know.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Did you hear that, Fang? It all adds up! Blitzie vanishing, the blood-curdling howling—it can only mean one thing!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|A poodle spook!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Blitzie may be trying to communicate with us from beyond! We have to find out what he wants!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/i|555}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|"Has your pet disappeared? It might be in another world trying to contact you. Call 555-LOST."}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I can almost feel the dog spirits calling me now!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|Oh my! Isn't this lucky!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Mrs. Byrerson, I was expecting your call!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|Oh, that's incredible!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Call it...intuition.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|Amazing!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Oops!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|What was that?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Oh, just the spirits. They're making a jam sandwich.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|Oh... Uh, could you please come over and help me contact my dearly departed dog?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Just what I was thinking. We'll be right over.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|Um, aren't you a little young to be contacting the spirit world, dear?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I think you'll find I'm wise beyond my years.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|This was Blitzie's room. I've kept everything just the way he liked it.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Eggbeater...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Ectoplasmic frother.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Fish bowl...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Crystal ball.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Oh. Juice...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|What's the juice for?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Drinking—the spirit world makes my throat dry.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Follow my lead. Everybody hold hands. Unh! Unh! Here, boy! Who's a good boy? Come on!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|The kink in my neck is gone!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|That's Blitzie's way of telling you something!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|What? What? I can't see!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Only the chosen can see.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Blitzie is in...the nether world.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|Huh?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Trapped in the astral prison.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|In what?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|He's been incarcerated in the ether pound!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|Oh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|It's a spirit kennel, where they keep the souls of captured dogs.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|Oh, dear, dear, dear!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|But how did he get there? We were in the backyard, gardening.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|He was taken there by...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dog catcher|Well, what have we here?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|...the evil phantom dog catcher! He roams the real world, at night, collecting doggy souls for his astral dog pound.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Phantom dog catcher|Huhuhuhahahahaha! Huhuhuhahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|Oh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|What about cats?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|He's allergic. Only dogs for this phantom!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Don't you worry. I'll spend every waking moment trying to free Blitzie's tormented spirit from the clutches of the evil phantom dog catcher!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Mona! Lily! Lunchtime!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Right after lunch, that is!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Ooh! I am feeling kind of hungry.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|How are we gonna free Blitzie? I've never been to the nether world before.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Neither have I, but I'm sure it's on the bus route.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hmm... Now, if we had a dog to use as bait, we could trick the phantom dog catcher into leading us right to the ether pound.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|But we don't know any dogs.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow... Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|What do you think?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|A little more mousse.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Wait a second!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Perfect!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|He's coming!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Now remember, Fang, if you go through with this, I'll give you a whole can of sardines!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dog catcher|Now that is the ugliest dog I've ever seen.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dog catcher|Mm, must be one of them rare breeds.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dog catcher|Come here, boy!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dog catcher|This dog's got moves like a cat!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dog catcher|Gotcha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dog catcher|Hahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Nether world, here we come!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dog catcher|That's it, keep moving!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|How insidiously clever! This ordinary kennel is the gateway to the astral dog prison! Let's go rescue Blitzie and Fang!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Audience on TV|Aww!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Look at them all—ready to be shipped to the astral plane.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|How?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Through that!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|A vending machine?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|No, next to it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Follow me. Just don't let go of the hose.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily and Mona|Yahh! Yahh! Yahh! Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Mona, you're in black and white!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Of course. This is the astral dog plane. Dogs only see in black and white.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|This way!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Mona! Over here! It's Blitzie!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Phantom dog catcher|Ah, so you've freed my spirit collection!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Phantom dog catcher|I suppose I can always begin a new collection. Huhuhuhahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Phantom dog catcher|Achoo!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Fang!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Phantom dog catcher|Achoo! Achoo! Achoo!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily and Mona|He's allergic to cats!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Phantom dog catcher|Not so fast!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Run!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Phantom dog catcher|Huhuhuhahahahahahaha! Ha! Dead end! You can run, but you can't—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Sic him!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Phantom dog catcher|Good doggies, good doggies, good doggies, good doggies, good doggies!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Phantom dog catcher|Give that here! That's not a toy. It's mine! Please?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|No way, dognapper. I've figured it out. This net is the source of your power.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Mona, the gateway is closing!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Phantom dog catcher|Hahahahaha! Now you'll be trapped here forever!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Everybody out!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Phantom dog catcher|Wait! No!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Phantom dog catcher|Come back here!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Bye!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Phantom dog catcher|Aw, darn it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Woohoo!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|This way to liberty!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dog catcher|Hey! Hey! Let me out! Hey! My water dish is empty!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Did Blitzie show up yet, Mrs. Bryerson?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|No, sweetie. He hasn't come home.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|That's strange. We freed all the dog souls from the astral kennel.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|At least you tried.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|Blitzie! Where have you been?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mrs. Bryerson|Out with a friend, I see. Oh, my.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|There's no telling what can happen when you cross the astral plane. It seems Blitzie met his soulmate.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|So what did you do today, Mona?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Oh, nothing special.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Same old, same old.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fang|Meow.}}

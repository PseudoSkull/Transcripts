{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|...and Charley is constructing an ant farm for the science fair.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Actually, the ants are constructing it. I'm supervising. Did you know ants think in unison? It's just like they're telepathic.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|And over here, George has a mold project in assorted Petri dishes.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|I discovered all these molds in my bachelor uncle's fridge. Look, the one that looks like saliva pulsates.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|Ugh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Thank you, George.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|I'm growing beans and talking about photosynthesis.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Thank you, Lily.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lawrence|I have a poem to go with each butterfly.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Very nice butterfly project, Lawrence.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|And this is Angela's project.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Oh, welcome, Principal Shawbly. I hope Miss Gotto didn't bore you too badly with all those other projects. Now, what I have here is a huge mechanized remote-control model of the Solar System.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Dave|Agh! Agh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|That's Dave. My dad hired him to tighten the bolts for me. You will notice that I have chosen to put the Earth in the center of the Solar System. Well, this is because I live on Earth, and without me it's hard to imagine... Hey!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I'm attempting to extricate dinosaur DNA from Jurassic-era crystallized amber tree sap I ordered from the back of a ''Von Kreepsula'' comic book. Then, I'll deposit it into my life-size papier-mâché Frankensteinosaurus rex.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Everyone knows Frankensteinosauruses never really existed.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|They will exist, as soon as I get the right chemical enzymes in its brain cavity. My very own Frankensteinosaurus rex!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Dinosaurs didn't have very big brains, but this Frankensteinosaurus rex sure will.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|You're going to wish you had a bigger brain, Mona, when you lose the science fair tomorrow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|There. Dinosaur DNA, spliced with haggis enzymes and the primordial ooze, inserted into the cranium.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|According to the recipe in this comic book, after stirring gently, let sit overnight, and by tomorrow, I'll have my very own Frankensteinosaurus rex!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Principal Shawbly|Good work, young scientists! Remember, the judging of the science fair will take place tomorrow afternoon, right after the Our Town Parade.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Principal Shawbly, the grade sixers want to show you their ''Titanic'' project in the drama room.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|You'd better hurry.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Principal Shawbly, I'm not done showing you my pro...ject. Ugh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Hmm... George! I've got a little plan, just to make sure Mona's monstrosity doesn't win first prize.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Okay, tell me all about it.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mr. Parker|Goodnight, honey. Good luck in the science fair tomorrow.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Goodnight, Dad.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|And to think, as we lie here, my Frankensteinosaurus rex's brain is starting to awaken, one hundred million years after the last dinosaurs!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|With Mona's dumb dinosaur out of the way, George, the first prize will be all mine. Hahahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|What about my mold project?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Can't you think of anything other than yourself? Hmph!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Where are we going to hide this thing?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|I know just the place.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Come on!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|This is where they're storing the floats for tomorrow's Our Town Parade.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Mission accomplished. Let's go!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela and George|Huh?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Unh! It won't budge. George, help me! Unh! Unh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|Let's go up that ladder and crawl out the window!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|Ugh! It's locked! Oh! Unh! Ugh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|This is all your fault—you, Mona, and her stupid Frankensteinosaurus!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela and George|Huh?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Your Frankensteinosaurus! It's gone!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Do you know what this means?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Someone stole it!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|No, it means it's brain was activated by the primordial ooze. It's alive, and out there somewhere, looking for its mommy—me!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Has anyone seen Angela and George? They weren't in homeroom this morning.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona, Charley, and Lily|No, Miss Gotto.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|I think your Frankensteinosaurus was stolen.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lawrence|Guys, yesterday, I saw George and Angela looking at your project and whispering.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|They shouldn't tamper with a Frankensteinosaurus rex.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela and George|Ahh! It's alive! Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Janitor|Ahh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|...and that's obviously what happened. It ate George and Angela, then made a break for it.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|Yeah, that's one theory. Another theory could be that a float started rolling, broke through the door and, uh, rolled away.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Oh, of course, a cover-up! You know, the whole town would panic if they knew a misunderstood Frankensteinosaurus was on a blood-thirsty rampage! Your secret's safe, officer. I don't want to cause an international panic any more than you do.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|We've gotta find him, and fast. If he gets frightened, this whole town could be destroyed. Come on!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|The thing is huge. Where could it be hiding?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Frankensteinosauruses may be big, but they're notoriously good hiders.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|My vampire senses are tingling, but still no sign of the Frankensteinosaurus.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|We just have to find him before they do!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|There's no telling what could happen!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Now I know how my Mom feels when I come home late for supper.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Hey, it's almost time for the Our Town Parade!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Of course! Where else would he be hiding?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|Let's go!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|Where'd you find it?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tractor driver|Down by the lake, early this morning. Must've rolled down from the warehouse. I'm hauling it back into town. Hope I'm not too late for the parade.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Eehuh! Oh...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tractor driver|Uh, excuse me, ma'am. What happened to the parade?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Miss Gotto|Uh, it went thataway.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Hey! There he is!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Here, boy! Come on! Come to Mama!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Uh-oh.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Keep calm! It's more afraid of us than we are of it!}}
}}

{{ft/i|{{c|POLICE}}}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|Attention! Attention! Listen up, you big galoot!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|He's not a big galoot! He's really quite timid and calm. We have to save the poor thing.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|We've got you surrounded! Put your front claws over your head and... Mona, come back!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Stay!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|Get out of the way!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Stop!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Good boy! See? You have to be firm but gentle when you're dealing with a creature that has superhuman strength.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|It could have squashed you!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Oh, no. My Frankensteinosaurus would never do that—I'm its creator. But I admit, if I wasn't, it probably would have eaten me.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Charley|Like it ate Angela and George.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|Come on, son. It's just a load of papier-mâché. It's not alive. It couldn't eat anyone.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela and George|Help! Help!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Good thing he didn't chew when he swallowed them.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela and George|Ahh! Oof!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|And it's also a good thing I didn't get around to putting in that digestive system.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|I'm going to sue you, Miss Vampire!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Well, if the Frankensteinosaurus didn't eat them, then how did they end up in his stomach?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|We were at the top of the ladder when it came rolling towards us. We fell into it its mouth and—}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Sure you did, George.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|Of course they did.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|All nice and dandy, Officer Halcroft, but a little too tidy. If everything you say is true, and the Frankensteinosaurus was rolling around on an out-of-control gurney...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|Yes?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|Then how do you explain this?!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lily|A giant footprint!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|George|A ''T. rex''!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Angela|A Frankensteinosaurus!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Officer Halcroft|Hmm....}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mona|I rest my case.}}
}}

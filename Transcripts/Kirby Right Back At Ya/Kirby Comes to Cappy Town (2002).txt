{{ft|King Dedede|I need a monster to clobber that there Kirby.}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Monster? That's ridiculous! There's no monster in this castle!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cappy|Yes, there is. It's big and it's scary and it eats everything in sight.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|That's King Dedede. There's no monster. Now go back to your homes so His Majesty can finish his supper in peace.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Hey, wait a minute, Escargoon, not so fast! How do we know you're not lying again?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|Yeah, like you usually do!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|You have no right to speak to me that way. Your parents should slap you silly.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Papa, something funny is going on.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Sir Ebrum|You might be right, Tiff. A monster is the kind of thing Dedede would love.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lady Like|The King must be behind this!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|You're the court official. How dare you accuse His Royal Highness?! Want me to check them in for a two week stay in the dungeon, sweet kingy?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Hahahahaha! A monster, huh? Would the monster happen to look anything like that?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cappy 1|That's it!}}
{{ft|Cappy 2|That's the monster!}}
{{ft|Cappy 3|Except it was a hundred times bigger!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Hahahahahaha! Well, you can see this ain't no monster. It's my new pet octopus. And the only thing he likes to eat is sardines. Hahahahaha! Little fella wouldn't hurt a fly, unless it was on the end of a fishhook. Hahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Of course it wouldn't. Now get out and go back to your trailer parks so the King can have his dessert. Go on, poof, you're gone!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kabu|Tell me, citizens of Dream Land, for what purpose have you come to consult me?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Sir Ebrum|We seek your wisdom and knowledge, Kabu. For three nights, a giant monster has been stealing our sheep.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lady Like|And it's robbing me of my beauty sleep.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mayor Len|King Dedede says it's not his monster.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Chief Bookem|But I don't believe that rascal!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|You know the truth, Kabu.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Please tell us where the monster is, Kabu, and how we can make it go away.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kabu|The monster is here, and all Dream Land is in grave danger.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Why did he come here?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kabu|It was called here by your own King Dedede.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Sounds like the big Kabu-na's got your number, crowny. Ow!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|That tattletalin' tiki!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kabu|The monster was created by one far more powerful than King Dedede.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Chief Bookem|I'd like to lock both of them up!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mayor Len|What could we do to stop them?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kabu|There is nothing you can do.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Sir Ebrum|Oh, dear!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lady Like|Oh, dear me!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Falala|Then is Dream Land doomed?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Can anybody help, Kabu?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kabu|There is one hope. A Star Warrior traveling through space, whose name is Kirby.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Kirby...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|Yay, Kirby!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Hm, bet he's cute!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Hahahahaha! That's trash you're talkin', Kabu. Ain't no such person as Kirby.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|That's right, you're full of Kabu-loney.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kabu|Kabu can see the future.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Hahahaha! Then why don't you predict what's gonna happen when I push this here button?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kabu|I predict you will not push it.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Hey, Escargoon, did you hear that one? Hahaha! Well, I predict you're dead wrong!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Looks like an alien invader.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Mash it with your mallet!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Wait a second! Let's see what it is! Are you a space alien?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Poyo?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|It's gotta be impossible, but your name wouldn't happen to be Kirby?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Ooh! Kirby! Kirby!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|That's Kirby?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Sir Ebrum|The Star Warrior?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lady Like|It's so pink!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Hahahahahaha! Some warrior. Now stand back. This boy's goin' into orbit.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|No! Please don't!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Fore! Haha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Sir Ebrum|Well, that seemed unnecessary.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lady Like|Why did you have to clobber that Kirby?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|The King just saved you all from a public menace!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Yeah, Kirby must've been the monster that's been eatin' up all the sheep.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lady Like|I hope that little pinky's alright.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|I'll go see.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|Me too!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Good riddance, I say.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Kirby! Just hang on! We're coming down to help you!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Huh? Aah!}}
{{ft|Kirby|Huh?}}
{{ft|Tiff|Aah!}}
{{ft|Tiff|Aah! Aah! Aah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Huh? Kirby just saved my life.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|A monster wouldn't have done that, Tiff.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Falala|You're right, Tuff. Maybe Kirby is a Star Warrior.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Impossible, Falala. Warriors are big and strong, not pink and puffy. Huh?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|Hey, Kirby, where are you going? Kirby, wait for us, will ya?!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fololo|He doesn't understand!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Falala|Don't let him get away, Fololo!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Some warrior.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Falala|This is Cappy Town.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|And the people are called Cappies.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|My parents work for the King, and we live in the castle. In case you were wondering, my name's Tiff.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Name Tiff.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Name Tiff!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|I'm her brother, Tuff!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Tuff!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Fololo|And we're their friends, Fololo...}}
{{ft|Falala|And Falala!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Fololo. Falala?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|Guess Kirby must be a baby warrior.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Hey! Out of our way! I'll get that monster!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Aah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|Knock it off!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|It's not a monster!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|He ran into that watermelon patch.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|We're not gonna let you hurt our friend, Kirby!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Don't tell me what to do! I'm the King!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Wait! I have an idea.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|That's a good one, Escargoon. There's more than one way to skin a Kirby. Hahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mayor Len|Wonder where they're off to.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Chief Bookem|Hey, you kids alright?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Yeah, but where's Kirby? Kirby! Kirby! Kirby, where are you?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mayor Len|And as mayor of Cappy Town, I know I speak for everyone when I say that we're pleased and proud to welcome our honored guest, the mighty Star Warrior, Kirby!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Chief Bookem|I can speak for myself, thank you!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mayor Len|We all know that, Chief Bookem.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|Let's hurry up and eat.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Kirby doesn't understand what you're saying anyway.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Mayor Len|Then let's dig in, shall we?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Poyo!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|Augh! I knew I should've started eating.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Hey! What's the big idea, Kirby?!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Poy...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Kirby, wait!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Did you do this?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Falala|Maybe Kirby is the monster.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|We can't stay here. Come on!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|You are the one who ate all those sheep, aren't you?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Huh?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|If you tell us the truth, Kirby, maybe we can help you.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Huh?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|But if you don't, you're history!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Sword Knight|Hey! Let's check out this shack!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Blade Knight|[Intentionally unintelligible speech]}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Sword Knight|It's Tiff!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Blade Knight|[Intentionally unintelligible speech] and Tuff!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|Hi Sword, hi Blade.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|What are you two doing here?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Blade Knight|[Intentionally unintelligible speech] for the King.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Sword Knight|We're looking for a bloke named Kirby.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Hey, that's funny, so are we.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|But he's sure not in here.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Meta Knight|I am not so sure.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Whoa!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Meta Knight|It is...true.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Please, Meta Knight!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|Don't tell the King.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Meta Knight|The King is not the problem, for now. Now we have to find the real monster.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Aah! Oof!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Aah! Oof! How am I supposed to fix this thing if I don't have the owner's manual?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Careful with this starship, snail-brain! Once we get it fixed, we can send Kirby back where he came from.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Ooh, what's that?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Aah... I can tack this up in my dressing room.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Sire, we might need that!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|You just take care of business! And I'll take care of this star.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Why does he have to be so abusive? Self-esteem issues, anyone? Aah! Well, this is a pleasant surprise, I was just trying to fix your starship for you!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Oh... Oh... Oh?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Not my fault. See? Oh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Hmph. I order a monster and I wind up with a wimp. I didn't spend my cash for this newfangled online monster ordering system so I could fill my fish tank.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|NME sales guy|Welcome to Nightmare Enterprises, King Dedede. How can I assist you?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Look pal, I don't like to complain, but I paid you folks a lot of money for {{SIC|a|an}} octopus monster, and it turned out to be a little shrimp.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|NME sales guy|Just give it time, Your Highness, and I guarantee that little shrimp will grow on you.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|All right...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Kirby!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Sir Ebrum|Look, it's Kirby!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Lady Like|He's getting clumped by the King!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Meta Knight|Get away!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Hey, you're on our side.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Meta Knight|Look out!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|That must be the monster that ate all the sheep!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Meta Knight|Yes, and it has taken control of the King.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Cappy|It's going to destroy the castle!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Aah! Holy calamari!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Get back in your tank, you overgrown appetizer! Aah!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Find the receipt for this thing 'cause I want my money back!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Meta Knight|You had better leave, sire.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Kirby!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Ugh!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Oof, oof, oof, oof!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|That's it! Hahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Sure, now it's a keeper.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Oh no!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Meta Knight|Where did you get that?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|This? King Dedede dropped it, why?}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Meta Knight|That is the Warp Star, the source of Kirby's power.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Kirby!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|Tiff, look out!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Kirby!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Whoa!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|He sucked them up.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Just like he sucked up that dinner!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Meta Knight|It is Kirby's classic defense—inhale.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff and Tuff|Hooray!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Meta Knight|That is Kirby's copy ability. After inhaling an attack, Kirby can transform himself. Kirby has now become Fire Kirby.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Kirby!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Yay! Yippee! Hooray! Kirby! Yippee! Yay!}}
{{ft|Tuff|Yay! Alright, the monster! Hooray! Hooray!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|There goes my refund.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|NME sales guy|Well, it seems their puffy pink visitor is a Star Warrior after all.}}
{{ft|eNeMeE|Hahahahahahaha!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|I wish you could've stayed around a little longer, Kirby.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Poy...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|I hate long goodbyes, so just get on your ship and go.}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Goodbye, Kirby!}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Kirby|Poy, poy...}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tiff|Thanks for saving us!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Tuff|Come back and visit!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Hahahahaha! We'll make sure that don't happen.}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Goodbye for good!}}
}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|King Dedede|Hey, I do believe I've been star-struck. Come back here! Come back here!}}

{{ft/d|
{{ft|Escargoon|Get away from me!}}

Tiff: [knocking] Kirby!

Tuff: Well maybe he's still sleeping.

[Tokkori suddenly opens the door.]

Tokkori: Be quiet ya palookas! Can’t you see we’re sleeping ? Beat it!

Tiff: Tokkori…

Tuff: Hey, what are you doing in Kirby's house?

Tokkori: Well, your little pink pal and I trade homes. I moved into his house and he moved into my tree. [flies over to Kirby] Rise and shine. You got company!

[Tokkori pecks Kirby, which causes him to fall out of the tree. He rolls to a stop in front of Tiff and Tuff.]

Tuff: Wake up Kirby! Trouble's coming.

Tiff: We just came from King Dedede's castle. You see, this morning-

Melman: Is this Kirby’s house?

Tuff: We're kinda busy here Mr. Melman.

Melman: Sorry Tuff. Just doing my job. Got a special delivery letter here from, uh, from uh, let's see…

Tiff: [taking the letter] Here. It's from Meta Knight!

Kirby: Poyo?

Tiff: [reading] "Honorable Kirby. As a fellow Star Warrior you are required to accept my challenge. I hereby request a battle with you."

Kirby: [happily] Poyo. Poyo!

Tuff: What are ya so happy about? Meta Knight challenged you to a duel!

Kirby: Poyo?

[Theme Song]

[Opens on villagers gathered around the tree in the center of town. They are talking to Tokkori, who is perched on a branch.]

Bookem: A challenge?

Mayor: From Meta Knight?

Hana: For a duel?

Mayor: I don't believe it.

Tokkori: Believe it Blustergas. I saw the letter with my own eyes. If you think it's a fake, then ask Meta Knight himself!

Mayor: But why would he want to battle Kirby?

Bookem: And where's Kirby now?

Tokkori: Tiff and Tuff took Kirby to Kabu Canyon.

Bookem: Kabu Canyon?

Mayor: Why would they take Kirby there?

Tokkori: Regardless, he’s going to be pummeled.

[Camera cuts to show their hiding place in the canyon. Lololo and Lalala are with them.]

Tiff: Kirby, there's something we have to tell you.

Kirby: Poyo?

Tiff: We know why Meta Knight challenged you. [flashback] Tuff and I were leaving the castle to come visit you, when we saw Meta Knight going up to King Dedede's throne room. So we decided to stay and see what was going on.

Meta Knight: You want me to challenge Kirby to a duel?

Dedede: That's right. If I want to defeat Kirby, you're going to challenge him. This is your chance to show your loyalty to me. You have fast movements in your experience of swordsman skills. This will be a piece of cake for you.

Escargoon: Just make sure you give that little crumb his just desserts. We're going to test Kirby’s skills.


Meta Knight: Kirby does not attack us, therefore I will not attack him. But if you want to eliminate him, why don't you order another one of your monsters?

Dedede: Monsters? What makes you think I been ordering monsters?

Meta Knight: I have heard rumors Your Majesty. I have even heard that the delivery system is located in this very room right below me.

Escargoon: Keep your nose out of the king's business, if you even have a nose.

Dedede: It's a knight's job to do what I say and I say get rid of Kirby!

Meta Knight: I understand, but-

Escargoon: Forget your but! Why don't you just do what the king orders?! Listen mister. If you're in cahoots with this Kirby, that's treason!

All( Meta Knight, Blade, Axe, Mace, Trident, Javelin and Sword Knight ): Treason?!

Dedede: [Hitting Escargoon] Are you gonna take care of Kirby or not?

Meta Knight: If you command it, I must obey.

Dedede: Then take your sword, get out there and slice him into ribbons!

[ Meta Knight and his followers exit out of the door while Tiff and Tuff ran out of the castle.

Mace Knight: But Sir Meta Knight, why do we have to defeat Kirby?

Javelin Knight: According to your last statement, “ I am glad that Kirby is finally here. There is some hope in order to defeat our enemy.”

Axe Knight: What are you thinking about, Mister Meta Knight.

Meta Knight: Axe Knight. I know he is a Star Warrior, but he must be prepared to fight faster foes.

Trident Knight: That may be so, but I think he's using you for something else.

[Flashback over]

Tiff: You're in a lot of trouble Kirby.

Kirby: Poyo…

Tuff: There's no way you can beat Meta Knight. The best thing to do now is to run and hide someplace.

Meta Knight: It is too late for that.

[Camera shows him looming over them from a high cliff. Sword, Blade and the Meta Knights are beside him. Cue fanfare.]

Meta Knight: If you wanted Kirby to escape from our duel, why did you come here?

Tiff: Well, because we wanted to talk to you.

[Meta Knight agilely jumps down and lands on a pedestal of rock.]

Tiff: We thought you were on our side, and Kirby's side too!

Tuff: We heard you tell Dedede you'd get rid of Kirby.

Meta Knight: I am his Majesty's loyal servant. I am sorry, but I cannot disobey his commands.

Tiff: Traitor!

[Tiff runs forward, but Sword and Blade stop her. Meta Knight draws his sword. At first it's just a hilt, but lightning shoots out and forms the sacred sword Galaxia. Meta Knight raises it and speaks.]

Meta Knight: Kirby. My king has commanded me to challenge you to a duel! Be prepared and let our duel commence !

[Meta Knight runs forward and springs into the air. He knocks Kirby around with his sword before stopping and pointing the sword at him.]

Meta Knight: Had it been at this angle, you would be sliced in half. This duel is about to end.

Tuff: That's what you think!

Tiff: Kirby! You can win, Kirby! Just try to inhale him!

Tuff: Suck up his sword!


[Kirby tries to suck Meta Knight up, but he just stands there. The suction creates a whirlwind of rocks around the area. The camera zooms out to show Meta Knight from the point of view of King Dedede's binoculars.]

Escargoon: Who's winning, sire? Meta Knight or Kirby?

Dedede: I can't tell. There's too much stone and sand.

[Camera shows sand being sucked into the canyon. Tiff and Tuff are holding on for dear life, while Sword and Blade duck behind a rock. The Meta-Knights duck behind a ledge. Meta Knight doesn't move at all, and Kirby grows tired and stops.]

Meta Knight: Kirby is very powerful, but he cannot suck up opponents who are extremely large and heavy, no matter how hard he tries.

Tiff: But you're not big or heavy, Meta Knight.

Meta Knight: I have other ways of defending myself.

Tiff: You know way more than Kirby does. He can't beat you. How can you pick a fight with him when he can't even defend himself?

Meta Knight: Even as his enemy, I am fair. Sword Knight, give him a way to defend himself.

[Sword throws a sword. It spins through the air and lands point down in the ground in front of Kirby.]

Meta Knight: There. Now we can battle as equals.

Tiff: Kirby! It's a trap!

Tuff: Run Kirby!

[Meta Knight waits patiently for his decision. Kirby doesn't back down and jumps for the sword. He grabs the handle, but it topples over. He recovers and picks it up, but he can barely hold it with both hands.]

Meta Knight: Now, the battle begins!

[Meta Knight springs into action. Kirby blocks the first few attacks but is comboed and sent flying. Meta Knight comes in for another attack as he gets up. Kirby swings his sword around wildly and manages to block the attack.]

Meta Knight: Fine then. I will save enough power to defend myself, but still move on to more intense attacks. [attacks] Keep your wits about you! [Kirby deflects an attack] The best offense is a good defense, my friend. [proceeds to bounce Kirby around with his sword]

[Kirby gets a good bashing and is sent flying into a rock wall. Stones fall down over him. Tiff and Tuff gasp while Escargoon celebrates.]

Escargoon: Kirby is finished!

Dedede: Come on. Let's get to the castle.

Escargoon: [driving away] Now we know what Kirby's weakness is.

Dedede: Aha! Kirby's no swordsman, and that gives me an idea. Haha!

[Meta Knight walks over to an outcropping of rock. The children watch anxiously.]

Meta Knight: A true Star Warrior would stand up and fight.

Tuff: Kirby don't listen to him!

Tiff: Run away Kirby!

Tiff: Meta Knights, can't you do something?

[Axe Knight hugs Tiff]

Axe Knight: I'm sorry guys, but I don't think its going to end very well. He just doing what all knights supposed to do: be loyal to the king.

[Kirby ignores them and goes on the offensive. After a particularly strong attack, Meta Knight pauses for a moment.]

Meta Knight: Your spirit is willing, my friend, but your pink flesh is weak. [attacks]

Tuff: Look Tiff. Kirby's fighting back. If he keeps this up, maybe he can beat Meta Knight.

Tiff: Or maybe Meta Knight's just acting like Kirby has a chance to win the duel.

Meta Knight: Not bad. [breathes] You have a lot of heart. Unfortunately, you don't have a lot of reach. With those tiny arms you cannot touch me. [leaps back] But, if you truly focus your powers, nothing is unreachable. And I will prove it to you. The steel of this sword is hard, but the steel of my will makes it harder.

[Meta Knight jumps high into the air, his sword glowing. He swings it forward and a huge beam of light gouges the ground beside Kirby.]

Meta Knight: If you allow your power to flow into your sword and then release it, you create the Sword Beam.

[Meta Knight unleashes another Sword Beam, this time directly at Kirby. He moves out of the way, but the beam goes up the cliff-side and sends rocks raining down.]

Meta Knight: Sword Beam allows you to use all of your power in one concentrated attack. When the spirit is focused, energy leaves the body and enters the sword. If you focus, perhaps you can defeat me. Try it. It is your only hope. If you fail, my sword will defeat you.

[Kirby blinks, and Meta Knight takes a step forward. Kirby blinks again, then sits down and falls asleep. Meta Knight gasps in surprise. He sees Kirby glowing in space, and the camera shows him also in space. Fade to black for commercial. Fades back in to Tiff and Tuff.]

Tuff: Kirby just fell asleep!

Tiff: Kirby!

Meta Knight: Kirby is free of all anxiety. That is how he focuses his power. He will be difficult to defeat, but for the sake of honor, I must try!

[Meta Knight attacks and Kirby wakes up. Before either can do anything, a huge boulder falls from the sky. Meta Knight pushes Kirby out of the way.]

Meta Knight: Look out!

[Meta Knight loses Kirby in the resulting dust cloud.]

Meta Knight: [coughs] Where are you?

Tiff: Tuff, Kirby got knocked out.

Tuff: What are we gonna do?

Lalala: Let's get him out of here.

Tuff: Yeah. Come on!

[Tiff and Tuff carry Kirby away. Camera cuts to King Dedede driving up to his castle. When they come to the drawbridge, Escargoon falls off for some reason.]

Escargoon: [cries out] I'm okay…

[Dedede runs into the throne room, giggling to himself mischievously. He hops onto his throne and activates the delivery system.]

Dedede: I know how to beat Kirby. I watched and saw that Kirby is no good with a sword.


Customer Service: We've got just the thing you're looking for, King. But unfortunately we haven't received payment for the other monsters Nightmare Enterprises sent you already.

Dedede: You'll get the money, just get that monster! Hurry it up !


Customer Service: No problem. We always give credit where credit is due.

[The system activates, and electricity shoots out as the transfer begins in the middle. A monster starts to come through as Escargoon arrives.]

Escargoon: I landed on my-

[He sees something is happening and shuts up. The lightning is starting to clear up.]

Customer Service: Allow me to introduce our Big Beetle, Bugzzy.


[The light clears away to reveal a giant purple stag beetle-like monster having enormous mandibles. He has four thin, yellow limbs, and wears white gloves on his hands and white shoes on his feet.]

Customer Service: This buggy beast has large mandibles, being able to grasp his foes tight. He is a wrestler that has won 100 battles who wishes to battle Kirby from hearing how powerful he is. If you want, will give you an extra monster, who is known as Hornhead.

[Bugzises raise his fists.]

Dedede: Ahahahaha! Amazing! Kirby’s definitely going to be pummeled. But I need a monster that's skilled in swordsmanship.

Customer Service: These bugs can withstand a scratch from the swords.

Dedede: Good. Let's find him and flatten him.

[Camera transitions to show where Kirby, Tiff, Tuff, Fololo, and Falala are hiding. Sword, Blade and Meta Knight are searching for them.]

Sword: Kirby!

Blade: Kirby where you hiding? Meta Knight, there's no sign of Kirby.

Sword: With a little more time, you could have taught Kirby to master the Sword Beam.

Meta Knight. Yes, and now I feel King Dedede will order a monster skilled in a different technique. Kirby's in danger. We must find him.

Trident Knight: I wonder what monster is he sending.

[With a flourish of Meta Knight's cape, they head off.]

Tuff: Huh? Now they sound like they're trying to protect Kirby.

Tiff: Boy Tuff. This is real confusing.

[They notice a shadow and look behind them to see Kabu.]

Tiff: Meta Knight came here to see you, didn't he Kabu.

Kabu: He came here to consult with me, about the threat to our planet.

Tiff: Threat to the planet? What do you mean, Kabu?

[Camera zooms in on Kabu's eye.]

Kabu: There is a secret empire of evil, ruled by one known as Nightmare. It is his plan to control the entire universe. [shows a chess board filled with monsters. Nightmare  is in the back, placing pieces.] He creates thousands of monsters and delivers them to customers like Dedede, [Nightmare attempts to place a small circular object] who does not know their true purpose. But Nightmare made one grave mistake. [Shows Nightmare getting frustrated that the piece refuses him] One creature was produced that would not obey his orders, [the piece is now stabbing Nightmare in the finger with a sword] and Nightmare fears it may defeat him. [Nightmare smashes the chess board in anger]

Tiff: The creature must be…Kirby!

Tuff: Yeah, that must be why Nightmare's trying to get rid of him.

Kabu: That is the likely explanation. Nightmare also made previous creature to have self control and heart

Tiff: Well we better get going Kabu. Thanks for the information.

Tuff: But Kabu, how'd you find out about all this stuff?

Kabu: I learned it long ago from Meta Knight.

Tuff: Say what?!

Tiff: From Meta Knight?

[Camera cuts to Dedede driving away from the castle, with Bugzzy flying beside the tank car.]

Dedede: [laughs] This job's gonna be a walk in the park.

Escargoon: Yeah, and Kirby's been bugging us, so now we're gonna bug him big time.

Bugzzy: Buuuuuuh.

[Camera shows Tiff, Tuff, Lololo, and Lalala gathered around Kirby, who is lying on a stretcher with an ice pack on his head.]

Lalala: He's still very weak.

Tuff: Hang in there Kirby.

Tiff: Come on. We gotta try to get him out of this valley here.

[Tiff peeks around a corner to see if the coast is clear. They move out, carrying Kirby on the stretcher, but they don't get very far before King Dedede shines his headlights and ambushes them.]

Dedede: Heheheha! Now you're in the spotlight!

Escargoon: But it's curtains for your little friend.

Tuff: Oh no!

Tiff: Run!

[They run away, but Escargoon drives after them. Tiff trips on a rock and Kirby goes flying into the car. He bounces off the hood, hits a wall, and falls to the ground. He wakes up from the sudden damage. When he looks up, Bugzzy is looming over him.]

Bugzzy: Hello Kirby. I heard your pretty strong after you defeat Octacon and Blocky. But it looks like you be weak when I finish you.

[Tiff and Tuff gasp. Bugzzy dashes forward and clamps Kirby in his mandibles. Buggzy flips backwards and smashes Kirby against the ground, sending him backward. Then he grabbed him again and Buggzy stomps on top of Kirby several times in quick succession. Buggzy grabs him again and makes a huge jump, holding Kirby over his head. At the climax of the jump, Buggzy flips so that the Kirby is below him, then slams him into the ground. Meta Knight walks up to Dedede's car.]

Meta Knight: What is that, Your Majesty?

Dedede: Haha. It's my new monster, Bugzzy.

Meta Knight: I do not understand. I thought you wanted me to do battle with Kirby.

Escargoon: You found Kirby's weakness. That's all we wanted.

Meta Knight: So, you were only using me to find the right monster to order. [watches Bugzzy attack a few times] Kirby's new power will now be put to the test.

[Commercial. Kirby dodges some more attacks]

Tiff: Kirby, do something!

Tuff: Kirby, try to suck it up!

[Kirby tries to inhale it, but Bugzzy stands his ground and Kirby has to stop. Bugzzy approaches him, and it becomes apparent Kirby has cornered himself. ]

Tiff: Hurry Kirby. Try to suck it up again.

Meta Knight: His opponent is too large to defeat that way.

Tiff: You're right, Meta Knight. [Bugzzy leaps into Kirby and attacks]

Buggzy: Ladybuggzies, attack.

[ Buggzy produce two ladybug enemies. Kirby tries again, focusing on the bugs. Meta Knight throws Galaxia and knocks them out . They spin into Kirby's mouth and he swallows it.]

Tuff: Yeah! Kirby did it!

[Kirby jumps up. After he flips, Kirby interacts with a wooden dummy in a boxing ring. Kirby punches it and it flies out of the ring. He then gains slightly dark tan skin and wears a blue headband with a brown leather like patch that has two small gold stars on each side and a gold medal depicting a trophy with a star on the very front.]

Meta Knight: He is now Suplex Kirby.

Tiff: Kirby…

Escargoon/Dedede: Suplex Kirby?!

[Suplex Kirby makes a few poses showing his muscles]

Meta Knight: A skilled wrestler, if he has learned any attacks.

Tiff: You can do it Kirby.

[Kirby lands and faces off with Bugzzy. Kirby and Buggzy then grasps limbs, before pushing each other to different sides.]

Dedede: [choking Escargoon] Ahahaha! Yeah, alright! Show your stuff, Buggzy!

[ They face off for a moment before Kirby goes on the offensive. Kirby forces Bugzzy to back up a few steps. It gets angry and flies into Kirby, pushing Kirby back.]

Dedede: Yeah! A few more sweeps and its goodbye Kirby!

Escargoon: Touché!

Meta Knight: [to himself] Kirby, if you focus, you can defeat it.

[Kirby has a flashback to sleeping in the starship. He yawns and sits down. Tiff and Tuff gasp. Kirby falls asleep.]

Dedede: [laughs] Hey,  he’s going to sleep in the middle of the battle.

Escargoon: Hurry Bugzzy! Finish him off!

Bugzzy: Kirby! Wake up and fight! This isn't over!

[Kirby remembers the alarm waking him up and wakes up in real life. He jumps up into the air. Bugzzy narrows its eyes. Kirby launches off and grabs Buggzy. Bugzzy tries to fly away, but Kirby threw him to the ground. He then lands on Buggzy while spinning feet first. The kids cheer.]

Tiff: Yay! He won!

Tuff: [chanting] Kirby! You! Rule! Alright! Awesome!

[Kirby lands, no longer possessing the copy ability. He hears cheering and turns around. The townspeople are gathered at the top of the cliffs, cheering for him. Buggzy got up and walks up to Kirby.]

Buggzy: Kirby.

Tiff: Get ready Kirby!

[Buggzy reach his hand out to Kirby and they both shake hands.]

Buggzy: Calm down, my friends. I got to be honest, no one has ever beaten me after my battles. Thank you very much for putting up a challenge. Your Suplex ability has outmatched my skills.

[All of a sudden, the ground shook and a giant Japanese rhinoceros beetle monster known as Hornhead burst through hole in the canyon.]

Tuff: What is that thing.

Buggzy: Dedede order an extra monster along with me. That is Hornhead.

[Buggzy tries to push Hornhead away, but he pick Buggzy up and threw him to the wall.]

Tiff: What are we gonna do?

Meta Knight: Kirby, inhale the sword in that stone !

Buggzy: Hurry Kirby! I don't think I can hold him off much longer.

[Kirby inhales the sword and he jumps up. After he flips, Kirby spins and forms his hat, the tip of which then falls on his face. He straightens the hat and takes out his sword.]

Meta Knight: It is Sword Kirby.

[Kirby slashes it with his sword several times, scratching him in the process. Kirby suddenly falls asleep.]

Buggzy: Kirby, wake up! (grunts)

[ Hornhead kicks him out of the way. Kirby wakes up and his sword glows sending a Sword Beam. Buggzy lifts him up. Hornhead tries to block it with its swords, but the beam cuts through and slices it in half. Electricity darts between the two halves and Buggzy drops him and flies out of the way. Everybody gasps but Meta Knight. Hornhead explodes, trailing smoke into the air. Everyone cheers.]

Dedede: Grrrr! I have a bug who is a traitor and another one who has been sliced. I’ll have to do this myself!

[Dedede drives forward, but Meta Knight is in the way.]

Dedede: Step aside, Meta Knight!

Meta Knight: Sire, it is my duty to warn you. Kirby has great power now. You’ll be beaten like the others in seconds!

Dedede: Yeah, well you made Buggzy on the good side and made Kirby unbeatable!

Escargoon: Now get out of the way, you  traitor!

Meta Knight: How absurd.

[Meta Knight kicks the car, sending them careening backwards downhill.]

Dedede: What's happening?!

Escargoon: We're going backwards!

Dedede: I know that! Hit the brake!

Escargoon: I don't know (?). We're gonna crash!

Dedede: Do something!

Escargoon: Like what?!

Dedede: Break my fall!

[They explode at the bottom of the hill.]

Tiff: Thanks. Hey Meta Knight. Who you trying to protect here, King Dedede or Kirby?

Meta Knight: I am a loyal subject of the king. Why would I help Kirby?

Tuff: You help him defeat Buggzy and Hornhead.

Tiff: Kabu told us about Nightmare Enterprises, but I bet you could tell us a whole lot more.

Meta Knight: Someday.

[A ball of light shines right by Meta Knight. It produce a small, round, yellow insect with a navy blue exoskeleton with a frontal horn and an anterior projection. He has rear wing covers with transparent beetle wings. It has orange feet and large eyes with blue irises.]

Meta Knight: This here is Beetley. Not all monsters are evil. Some are good hearted like Buggzy. Be aware that Kirby will have a lot of allies in Dreamland, in order to defeated our greatest enemy.

Beetley:  Hello, I am Beetley. Who are you?

Meta Knight: I am Meta Knight, one of the Star Warriors.

Beetley: You seem to be good with a sword. But I gotta tell you something. [whispers] I'm from Nightmare Enterprises and they're cooking up something bad. Somehow like a storm. I don't know what it is, but it's bad news I tell you.

Meta Knight: Thanks for the information. Go with Kirby.

[ Beetley flies off. Camera shows Lololo and Lalala flying Kirby up to Kabu. Buggzy and Beetley follow up with them. ]

Tiff: Well then. We'll find out about Kirby one way or another.
